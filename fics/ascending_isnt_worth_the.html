    <h2 class="toc-heading">ascending isn't worth the paperwork</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Feng Xin really wasn’t meant to be a god.</p>
      <p>It was a thought he’d had often, back when he was helping Dianxia alongside Mu Qing during the crown prince’s
        first ascension, and it was even more obvious now that he had ascended by his own merits. He was fucking
        terrible at navigating the bureaucracy and politics of it all, and honestly had no desire to get any better at
        it.</p>
      <p>Sitting on the steps outside the palace of Jing Wen, Feng Xin tried to make sense of the enormous stack of
        initiation paperwork he’d been given.</p>
      <p>Did he just ascend at a bad time, or was getting started as a new god this confusing for everyone?</p>
      <p>Admittedly, his welcome to the heavens had been…pretty fucking lukewarm. There wasn’t even a gossiping crowd
        like there had been for Dianxia’s ascension, so Feng Xin had just wandered around aimlessly for a bit, trying to
        find a landmark he was familiar with, until a harried civil god had caught up with him, panting and out of
        breath.</p>
      <p>The civil god had dragged Feng Xin to the building he now knew as the Palace of Jing Wen, dumped this fucking
        stack of paperwork in his arms, told him that someone would contact him about a tour, and left him standing
        bemused on the steps outside the palace.</p>
      <p>Seeing as he was unsure where he was even supposed to fucking go, Feng Xin had sat down directly on the steps
        and started to go through the paperwork, hoping it would contain further instructions.</p>
      <p>…It did not.</p>
      <p>At least, not as far as Feng Xin could tell — actually, it looked like none of these forms were even applicable
        to him. The more he looked, the more he became certain that everything in the whole fucking stack was meant for
        “Middle Court officials”, as they were calling them now.</p>
      <p>There was a form to check off which duties one had previous experience with, a form to rank housing
        preferences, a form to join recreational clubs…the sheer volume of them made Feng Xin intensely grateful he’d
        gone directly to the Upper Court this time around.</p>
      <p>He could have sworn there hadn’t been this much paperwork when Dianxia had appointed him and Mu Qing as his
        deputy officials — but he supposed that made sense, since a lot of these forms seemed to be for getting assigned
        to work for an Upper Court official.</p>
      <p>The most important form seemed to be for ranking the Upper Court officials who were currently accepting new
        deputies by order of preference, which Feng Xin perused with interest.</p>
      <p>He recognized most of the names on the list from when he’d been Dianxia’s deputy, but the final name was
        unfamiliar: General Xuan Zhen.</p>
      <p>Surely they weren’t the only new god since Feng Xin had been here last?</p>
      <p>There didn’t appear to be any information about any of the established gods, at least not in a logical location
        within the stack, so Feng Xin figured he’d have to find out another way.</p>
      <p>But for now, he really needed to know where the fuck he was supposed to go.</p>
      <p>With a sigh, he gathered the papers back together and stood up to knock on the door of the Jing Wen palace.</p>
      <p>“It’s open!” someone shouted from inside, sounding irritated.</p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, how was I supposed to know it's fine to just fucking barge in?!</em>
      </p>
      <p>Feng Xin pushed the door open and walked up to the enormous desk at the front of the entrance hall. There was
        an exhausted-looking heavenly official sitting behind the desk, with thick spectacles and a pinched expression
        as if he’d been sucking on sour fruit. He didn’t acknowledge Feng Xin’s approach at all, not even when Feng Xin
        plunked the stack of paperwork onto the desk with a resounding thunk.</p>
      <p>“Excuse me,” Feng Xin said, scowling at being so thoroughly ignored. “This isn’t the right paperwork for a
        martial god in the Upper Court.”</p>
      <p>The other official didn’t speak, or even fucking look up from what he was writing, but he did raise a hand, one
        finger extended upwards, presumably to tell Feng Xin to wait.</p>
      <p>“Fucking fine,” Feng Xin muttered, trying not to sound too frustrated, and began pacing the entrance hall to
        keep himself from punching anything he shouldn’t.</p>
      <p>After an agonizingly long wait (which was probably less than an incense time, but well…Feng Xin was impatient),
        the man behind the desk finally cleared his throat, beckoned Feng Xin over, and said in a voice devoid of all
        emotion, “How can the Palace of Jing Wen assist you today.”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin gestured towards the stack of paperwork. “I ascended today and I was given the wrong forms. That shit
        looks like it’s for Lower…I mean Middle Court officials.”</p>
      <p>The other man shot him a dirty look — clearly he didn’t appreciate Feng Xin’s slip up — but started to flip
        through the stack of papers anyway. “Ah yes, none of this is applicable to you, I see.” His phrasing was polite,
        but his tone of voice sounded like he was trying to explode Feng Xin with his mind. “One moment.” He stood and
        swept through a door off to the side of the desk that Feng Xin hadn’t even noticed was there.</p>
      <p>It seemed like it took even longer for the Jing Wen official to come back than it had for him to acknowledge
        Feng Xin in the first place. But he did finally return, with—</p>
      <p>Oh hell fucking no.</p>
      <p>In his hands was a stack of paperwork — nearly twice as large as the one for Middle Court officials.</p>
      <p>…Could Feng Xin just fucking banish himself and be done with this already?</p>
      <p>Even though gods weren’t supposed to need sleep, Feng Xin suddenly felt exhausted. Maybe it’d be best to just
        deal with this all in the morning. “Where are the guest rooms here?”</p>
      <p>The other man sighed, clearly irritated beyond belief. “Accommodation information is on pages 19, 24, 28, and
        40 through 47. Map on page 3.”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin flipped through the stack right there, not wanting to have to come back again later if there were any
        issues.</p>
      <p>The map was thankfully easy to find, and not the most useless map Feng Xin had ever seen — he was able to
        locate the guest house and its relative position to the palace of Jing Wen fairly quickly, and he left
        immediately in that direction, not bothering to stop the palace doors from slamming shut on his way out.</p>
      <p>The guest house was…extremely decadent. Feng Xin had thought he was fairly used to opulence from spending most
        of his life at Dianxia’s side, but this scale of grandeur was on a whole other level from even the Xianle
        palace. And it was only the guest house! The gods’ actual palaces must be something else entirely.</p>
      <p>It felt really fucking weird to stay in a room so fancy on his own. Usually when the three of them traveled
        together, they’d either all share a room, or he and Mu Qing would share while Dianxia had a room to himself.
        Feng Xin couldn’t remember the last time he didn’t at least have Mu Qing with him in a place like this.</p>
      <p>Did Mu Qing stay here at the guest house too when he left them to return to the heavens? Or did he join a
        palace immediately? Feng Xin wasn’t sure if he ever knew the name of the god Mu Qing was working under,
        actually. Was he still working in the palace of that same god?</p>
      <p>…Was he even still in the heavens?</p>
      <p>Thinking about Mu Qing made Feng Xin’s chest hurt. He couldn’t tell which idea was making it worse: that Mu
        Qing was still here in the heavens, or that he’d already left before Feng Xin even arrived.</p>
      <p>Once his armor was off, he flopped onto the bed face first, forcibly put both the paperwork and Mu Qing out of
        his mind, and was asleep within minutes.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <hr />
      <p> </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, the enormous stack of paperwork was not any less intimidating in the morning. Feng Xin had
        already forgotten which pages the Jing Wen deputy had mentioned to him, and the organization of the papers was
        fucking abysmal. Nothing was grouped by topic, and it was impossible to tell which forms he should start with.
      </p>
      <p>Feng Xin groaned and slid off the bed onto the floor of the guest room. He really was not cut out for handling
        this kind of thing — shouldn’t the civil gods have things like this in order already?</p>
      <p>Eventually, he found the password to the general communication array. Of course, it didn’t come with any
        instructions — thank fuck Feng Xin still remembered how to join communication arrays — but wouldn’t a new god
        without any experience in the heavens be completely screwed?</p>
      <p>There was a bit of chatter in the array when he joined, but not so much that he’d feel bad for interrupting.
        “Does anyone know where to get started with the paperwork for new martial gods?”</p>
      <p>A chorus of voices overlapped: “Welcome!” “Ah, you must be new then!” “I thought I heard someone new had
        ascended.”</p>
      <p>“You must be Feng Xin?” a pleasant female voice said.</p>
      <p>Feng Xin made a noise of affirmation.</p>
      <p>“I apologize for the confusion around the paperwork. I am Nangong Jie, with the palace of Jing Wen. We can have
        someone come and assist you with it in…” The sound of rustling papers came through the array. “About twelve
        days.”</p>
      <p>Twelve days?! Feng Xin supposed that for a god that probably seemed like the blink of an eye, but sitting
        around doing nothing for twelve fucking days sounded like torture.</p>
      <p>“Can you at least tell me which forms I should start with?”</p>
      <p>“It might be best to start with the forms relating to your new palace. If you don’t want to wait for the Palace
        of Jing Wen, General Xuan Zhen ascended recently, so you can ask him for assistance. He is the most likely to
        remember how to get everything running, outside of those from our palace.”</p>
      <p>Someone snorted. “Good luck with that. He doesn’t seem the type to want to <em>assist</em>.”</p>
      <p>“Oh, don’t be like that, you haven’t even met him,” someone else said.</p>
      <p>“I don’t need to meet him! Yan Wei did and he said Xuan Zhen has no sense of loyalty—”</p>
      <p>Before the discussion could devolve too much, Feng Xin blurted out, “Who is General Xuan Zhen? And when did he
        ascend?”</p>
      <p>Silence descended. It was even quieter than when he had first joined the array — was there some kind of taboo
        around asking about people’s ascension?</p>
      <p>“Hah! See, I told you!” crowed the person who had criticized the new general. “He hasn’t even reached out to
        his former close companion! He wouldn’t help even if you gave him a whole pile of merits for it!”</p>
      <p>…Former close companion? It couldn’t be…?</p>
      <p>“He is Mu Qing, former deputy of General Jian Zou and His Highness Xie Lian.” Nangong Jie’s voice immediately
        confirmed Feng Xin’s thoughts. “He ascended last month.”</p>
      <p>Last month?! Wasn’t it almost unheard of for there to be less than a year between ascensions? The heavens must
        be playing some sort of joke for them to ascend so close together.</p>
      <p>Now that Feng Xin knew it was Mu Qing, he didn’t entirely disagree with the person that had been insisting
        General Xuan Zhen would never help him — it wasn’t like they had parted on good terms. And even if Mu Qing did
        want to help…the idea of accepting his help made Feng Xin’s chest feel tight again, as did the idea of having to
        talk about him in the public array. It felt like everyone would be able to hear in his voice how complicated his
        feelings were, even if they couldn’t see his face.</p>
      <p>“Thanks for the information, Nangong Jie,” he bit out. Then, thinking of Dianxia scolding him to be more
        polite, he added a quick “Good to meet you all,” before hastily disconnecting from the array.</p>
      <p>…Fuck.</p>
      <p>He missed them both fiercely — Dianxia and Mu Qing — no matter how reluctant his feelings were toward the
        latter. He really, really missed them.</p>
      <p>Still, he wasn’t ready to reach out to Mu Qing.</p>
      <p>Feng Xin slumped back on the bed, hoping desperately that it wouldn’t actually take twelve days for the Palace
        of Jing Wen to send someone.</p>
      <p>He spent the rest of the day trying to find and complete all the forms related to the construction of his new
        palace. It really did take all day, and left him with a headache at the end of it even though very little was
        actually accomplished. At least the guest house had decent food and wine, and a heated bath to relax in.</p>
      <p>…How ridiculous was it that a full day of battle stressed Feng Xin out less than a half day of dealing with
        paperwork and bureaucracy?</p>
      <p> </p>
      <hr />
      <p> </p>
      <p>On the third day, Feng Xin decided to abandon the paperwork in favor of finding somewhere to train. He was
        pretty sure all the martial gods had their own training grounds, so there probably wouldn’t be anyone to spar
        with, but target practice would do just as well.</p>
      <p>There were a few public training grounds marked on the map, so Feng Xin headed to the nearest one, marveling at
        the architecture and landscaping as he walked. It seemed like the heavenly capital had gotten even more
        beautiful since the last time he was here.</p>
      <p>The training grounds thankfully had bows and arrows stocked, since Feng Xin didn’t have a spiritual weapon of
        his own yet. As he’d expected, there was no one else around, so he spent several hours hitting the targets from
        various distances, feeling out how his body had changed since becoming a god.</p>
      <p>All his senses, but especially his vision, seemed extra-sharp now, and his muscles got tired much less easily.
      </p>
      <p>It was also much easier to use his qi than it had been before — he had never been the best at cultivating,
        usually distracted too easily to have good control over his spiritual energy, but it seemed to obey him much
        more readily now.</p>
      <p>Maybe now he could practice using qi to guide his arrows, for times when hitting a target normally would be
        impossible. His skill in archery had always been fully due to practice and physical mastery, but he’d always
        wanted to try some of the fancier cultivator tricks.</p>
      <p>The day went by in a flash, and Feng Xin felt much lighter at the end of it.</p>
      <p>He was in such a good mood as he settled into bed that he even contemplated reaching out to Mu Qing the next
        day — maybe not for help with the paperwork, but he <em>had</em> always been fun to spar with. Now that they
        were both gods, there was even more potential, since they could fight without concern for mild injuries, and he
        was strangely excited to see if Mu Qing’s strength still matched his own.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <hr />
      <p> </p>
      <p>On the fourth day, Feng Xin awoke to a package at his door.</p>
      <p>It contained some pastries and bao, a small sachet of tea, a note inside an envelope, and…another enormous
        stack of paperwork. Was this from the palace of Jing Wen? He groaned and decided to read the note first — maybe
        it wasn’t as bad as it looked.</p>
      <p>The note was written in elegant, flowing script — as expected of a civil heavenly official.</p>
      <p>
        <em>‘Eat breakfast first before you deal with the paperwork.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>Feng Xin snorted. Bossy.</p>
      <p>The pastries did look good though, and he grabbed one before continuing on with the note. It had a peach
        filling — one of his favorites.</p>
      <p>
        <em>‘Hopefully you haven’t wasted too much time on it yet. Use this version instead — it’s annotated and
          organized in a manner that actually makes sense. Not all of it has to be finished right away, but I suggest
          completing the form to request hot springs for your palace now — it’s a nightmare to get it added later if you
          don’t ask before the rest of it gets built.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>No signature.</p>
      <p>The tone was awfully familiar for someone he had never spoken to, so maybe Nangong Jie had taken pity on him
        and written this herself instead of making him wait in the queue for one of the other Jing Wen deputies to help.
        She seemed the efficient type.</p>
      <p>Flipping through the first few pages of the pile, Feng Xin could already tell this was a vast improvement from
        the original organization. The sender also seemed to have added quite a bit of information themselves — the
        first few pages contained communication array passwords and a quick introduction to the Upper Court gods and
        other important contacts, all written in that clear, flowing calligraphy.</p>
      <p>Among the passwords were Nangong Jie’s personal array, which was somewhat unexpected, but kind, seeing as she
        seemed to be one of the more competent civil officials, and General Xuan Zhen’s personal array, which was a bit
        of a shock. Wasn’t it kind of an unspoken rule not to give out the passwords to other gods’ private arrays?
        Maybe Nangong Jie had just assumed they were still close and that Mu Qing wouldn’t mind him having the password.
      </p>
      <p>Feng Xin was a bit curious to see what she had written about Mu Qing in the introduction to the gods. Despite
        (or maybe because of?) being the most recent addition, he was listed at the top of the first page. <em>‘Mu Qing
          — General Xuan Zhen. Ascended 29 days ago as a martial god. You already know all there is to know.’</em></p>
      <p>What kind of summary was that?! He absolutely did not fucking know all there was to know about Mu Qing!</p>
      <p>He’d met many of the other gods before, but their summaries were all much more fleshed out, so it couldn’t be
        Nangong Jie just skipping over people he was already familiar with. Did she also have something against Mu Qing,
        like that obnoxious god in the public array?</p>
      <p>Disappointed, Feng Xin set the rest of the summaries aside for later reading and got to work on the rest of the
        pile.</p>
      <p>The annotations were really incredibly useful. On the papers that were informational only, that elegant
        handwriting made footnotes and notes in the margins, all explaining points that Feng Xin had been confused on.
        For each of the more complicated forms, there was a cover page with explanations and suggestions.</p>
      <p>On the form for requesting official robes from the seamstresses: <em>‘In the “other comments” box, put what
          colors and types of fabric you’d like, and any suggestions on the design. They’ll hound you about it in person
          otherwise.’</em></p>
      <p>On the form for weekly supply delivery: <em>‘You can always make changes later if you end up needing other
          things, but at least ask for medical supplies now. The doctors here…leave something to be desired. I think you
          especially will want to see them as little as possible.’</em></p>
      <p><em>‘You especially’</em>? What was that supposed to mean? Because he’s a martial god, he’ll likely be getting
        injured a lot? Probably true, and he did prefer to take care of his own injuries when possible.</p>
      <p>Subconsciously, his mind went to the time Mu Qing had set his broken arm…that hadn’t been so bad either. He had
        been shockingly gentle, and didn’t try to make any awkward small talk like doctors usually did around Feng Xin
        for some reason.</p>
      <p>He shook his head quickly, trying to clear his mind of the memory. It wasn’t like Mu Qing would be treating his
        wounds here anyway.</p>
      <p>On the mission rules: <em>‘It’s not clear at all from this explanation, but missions will come mainly from the
          Palace of Jing Wen and other civil gods at first. Once you gain followers, you’ll need to start handling their
          prayers. Any action taken to grant a prayer also counts as a mission and needs to be documented somehow. You
          only need to submit reports in the official format for missions assigned by other palaces, but you should
          really keep detailed records of your own missions too. Also, the Palace of Jing Wen will absolutely make you
          rewrite reports if they can’t read them, so keep your handwriting under control. …Maybe you should prioritize
          getting a scribe.’</em></p>
      <p>Feng Xin raised his eyebrows. This amount of sass from a Middle Court official was a little shocking — he
        wouldn’t have pegged Nangong Jie as the type. But she was doing him a favor with these notes after all, and it
        wasn’t like Feng Xin really cared about rank like that. He was just…surprised.</p>
      <p>On the form for getting a personal communication array: <em>‘Don’t pick a password that’s a common phrase or
          you’ll get people coming into your array by accident. Sometimes in the middle of the night. I think they’re
          still trying to work out some issues with the array design, so hopefully it won’t always be an issue.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>On the form for library access: <em>‘Don’t bother writing out a justification for access to each room. You’re
          in the Upper Court so you automatically get access to all of it anyway. I honestly don’t know why they still
          make us fill out the form at all, but they won’t give you a key if you don’t, so just do the top part.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>On the form for selection of his palace’s location: <em>‘Their numbering system doesn’t make sense, so use this
          map instead. It has the available locations &amp; surrounding palaces labeled. Martial gods tend to stick
          together so people will be expecting you to pick a location near other martial gods, though you don’t have to.
          In my opinion, the ideal location is the first one I marked, but you should visit them all and see what you
          think.’</em></p>
      <p>Feng Xin picked up the aforementioned map. It looked like there were seven available plots of land for a new
        palace — four near civil gods and three near other martial gods.</p>
      <p>The first marked location was very close to the building labeled as General Xuan Zhen’s palace. The second was
        between the palaces of two martial gods who had both been extremely jealous of how Dianxia was favored by the
        emperor during his first ascension, so that was out, and the third was near the palace of a martial god whose
        name he didn’t recognize — General Ming Guang. They must be relatively new as well.</p>
      <p>So, it was either break the mold and live with the civil gods, live near a martial god he’s never met, or…live
        near Mu Qing.</p>
      <p>It didn’t seem like he’d made a very good impression with the civil gods so far, and he’d honestly be much more
        comfortable around martial gods, so it was really just between Ming Guang and Mu Qing.</p>
      <p>The swirl of emotions in his chest he felt at the prospect of living near Mu Qing was too complicated to
        decipher, so he decided to go look at the locations and choose based on the environment.</p>
      <p>He went to the location near General Ming Guang’s palace first. It was beautiful, but then again, all of heaven
        was. It was fairly close to the center of the capital, so just about everything was easily accessible, but there
        wasn’t a lot of open space, and there seemed to be quite a lot of people out and about nearby.</p>
      <p>Mu Qing’s palace was a little further out, near the edge of the heavenly capital, and the area was definitely
        quieter, being farther away from the main street. It was lush and green, full of trees and vegetation, and Feng
        Xin thought he could hear rushing water in the distance.</p>
      <p>The best land for building on was really…very close to Mu Qing’s palace though. They’d practically be sharing a
        back yard.</p>
      <p>He walked a little further to see the back of the property, the sound of rushing water getting louder, and…</p>
      <p>…Oh.</p>
      <p>This plot of land and Mu Qing’s both looked out at a waterfall, spilling over the cliffs surrounding the other
        side of a small lake.</p>
      <p>It was…perfect, actually. Even if it wasn’t a spiritual waterfall (which it most likely was, since this was
        heaven), the view was insanely beautiful, and Feng Xin had always found the sound of running water relaxing.</p>
      <p>The natural features of this location alone would absolutely be worth dealing with…whatever the fuck living
        near Mu Qing would entail.</p>
      <p>Feng Xin lost track of time a bit, looking out at the waterfall with his head the emptiest of thoughts it had
        been since probably before the fall of Xianle — until the sun began to set and it suddenly occurred to him that
        <em>Mu Qing fucking lived here</em>.</p>
      <p>He knew that already of course, but he hadn’t quite clocked that that would mean he could potentially run into
        Mu Qing right here, right now. The idea of it nearly made him dizzy. However their first encounter as gods went,
        it would likely be explosive in one way or another, and Feng Xin absolutely wasn’t ready for that.</p>
      <p>Feng Xin stood up, reluctantly turned his back on the waterfall, and booked it back to the guest house. Once
        inside his room, he resisted the urge to faceplant on the bed and not move until morning, and sat down at the
        desk instead.</p>
      <p>He wasn’t avoiding Mu Qing. He really fucking wasn’t! It was just — a good time to finish the paperwork anyway,
        since he’d made a decision on the palace location.</p>
      <p>Yep, that was definitely it.</p>
      <p>The rest of the paperwork went incredibly smoothly with the assistance of the notes. Feng Xin separated
        everything into three piles — forms to be turned in to the Palace of Jing Wen, documents to keep for reference,
        and documents he still needed to read.</p>
      <p>In a weird way, he was glad that he got to keep everything that had the elegant handwriting on it, since the
        forms themselves had no annotations on them. It felt like a reminder that he had at least one friend in the
        heavens already.</p>
      <p>One of the notes had advised him to drop off paperwork at the Palace of Jing Wen only after dark — apparently
        the deputy Feng Xin had met at the front desk was always that annoying to deal with, usually worse, and the
        night shift deputies were much more efficient, so Feng Xin had dinner before heading over to drop off the
        completed forms. He heated up the bao that were included in the package that morning with a quick burst of
        spiritual energy — marveling that he now had enough control over his qi to not instantly burn them — and
        prepared some of the tea as well.</p>
      <p>The bao were extremely delicious, just like the pastries — though they somehow tasted a bit nostalgic.</p>
      <p>Was all the food in heaven this fucking good?</p>
      <p>None of the forms had mentioned anything about food, presumably because Upper Court officials didn’t need to
        eat, but surely something had to be arranged for the Middle Court officials.</p>
      <p>Actually, Feng Xin probably needed to figure out if he’d be responsible for feeding his own deputies or if
        there was a collective dining hall that provided food.</p>
      <p>He’d already checked the box for a kitchen to be included as part of his palace, but he was only an average
        cook, and didn’t particularly have any desire to cook for others outside of desperate situations.</p>
      <p>Though, he supposed, he had all the time in the world to improve his cooking skills now.</p>
      <p>He flipped through the documents while he ate, looking for any notes on the subject, and found a few
        handwritten pages near the end with a surprisingly detailed explanation.</p>
      <p>
        <em>‘Regarding how you run your palace once you have deputies of your own, as far as I can tell there are no
          rules. Everyone seems to run their palace differently. You can have your deputies live in the palace with you,
          or they can stay in the dorms instead. The dorms for Middle Court deputies will take care of all their needs —
          food, laundry, cleaning services, whatever you can think of.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>‘But I will say that gods who go this route do not seem to have as close of a bond with their deputies. Of
          course, keeping them close can backfire too — the deputies of the Palace of Jing Wen live at the palace, but
          they are overworked and micromanaged because of it, and most would probably prefer to live in the dorms.
          Though I highly doubt micromanaging will be an issue for you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>‘If you do decide to have your deputies live in your palace, I recommend prioritizing finding a few who are
          decent at cooking. It feels like the only thing people ever talk about in the Middle Court array is food, so
          having decent meals will go a long way towards earning their loyalty.’</em>
      </p>
      <p>If that was the case, then Feng Xin should absolutely try to recruit whoever made the bao and pastries. It was
        somewhat surprising that not all the food was that good, but Feng Xin supposed there was only one god of cooking
        for a reason. Honestly, the goodies in his package were probably from that god’s palace — it seemed fitting for
        a welcome gift.</p>
      <p>By the time he finished reading, it was fully dark outside, so he headed over to the Palace of Jing Wen to drop
        off the completed paperwork.</p>
      <p>As the note predicted, there was someone Feng Xin had not seen before at the front desk, a young woman with
        blue-ish hair who looked exhausted. She looked up as the door shut behind Feng Xin.</p>
      <p>“Ah, you must be the newly ascended martial god. Feng Xin?”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin nodded.</p>
      <p>“I’m Nangong Jie. Good to meet you face to face. Is that the initial paperwork already?”</p>
      <p>Ah, so that’s why her voice sounded so familiar. “Yes, thanks to your help I was able to finish it today,” Feng
        Xin said, bowing in appreciation.</p>
      <p>“…My help?” Her eyebrows scrunched together in confusion.</p>
      <p>“…The notes you sent?” Feng Xin said, slightly confused himself now. “And thank you for the food as well. It
        was delicious.”</p>
      <p>Nangong Jie raised her eyebrows. “I didn’t send you any notes or food. I only put you in the queue for someone
        from my palace to come walk you through things. But it seems like you figured things out on your own.”</p>
      <p>…What the fuck? “Was it someone else from your palace who sent the package, then?”</p>
      <p>“It’s possible, but I have no way of knowing,” she shrugged. “As you can probably tell, the organization around
        here could use some improvement. Let me take a look at your forms and make sure you’re good to go.”</p>
      <p>Still somewhat in shock, Feng Xin handed over the papers. It must have been someone else from Jing Wen Palace.
        Maybe someone who just really fucking enjoyed welcoming new arrivals? Nothing else made sense.</p>
      <p>“Everything looks in order,” Nangong Jie said, snapping him out of his stupor. “I’ll have your title registered
        as General Nan Yang before tomorrow. I see you chose the plot in the outer city for your palace. Did you visit
        the potential locations in person?”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin nodded. “Figured it was better to actually see them before making a decision.”</p>
      <p>“Oh?” Nangong Jie looked surprised. “I’m surprised General Xuan Zhen didn’t chase you off…there’s a reason no
        one has dared to claim that plot yet.”</p>
      <p>“…Chase me off?”</p>
      <p>“That area was just made available for construction recently, so everyone’s been eager to look around and see
        if they want to move their palace there. But General Xuan Zhen has been…a bit territorial, to say the least.
        He’s apparently ‘hovered menacingly’ over everyone who’s come anywhere near the land adjacent to his, and at
        some point everyone decided it’s not worth getting on the bad side of a new martial god.”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin stared. If Mu Qing was so against anyone moving to that location, he’d have expected Mu Qing to
        forcibly and bodily remove him from the area as well. “Maybe he just didn’t notice I went to look? I’m sure
        he’s…busy.”</p>
      <p>“...Hm.” Nangong Jie looked skeptical. “…Maybe. Do you want me to hold off on sending in these forms, in case
        you change your mind? They probably won’t be ready to start construction for a few days regardless.”</p>
      <p>Feng Xin snorted. “Nah, I won’t change my mind. It is the best location, after all. If Mu Qing has a problem
        with it, I’m sure he’ll let me know.”</p>
      <p>“Very well. Some of the civil gods will be in touch to coordinate construction soon, then. Was there anything
        else?”</p>
      <p>“No, thanks though. If you ever find out who sent me those notes, tell them thanks for me too.”</p>
      <p>…Really, why didn’t they sign the note? Feng Xin mulled it over as he went back to the guest house for the
        night.</p>
      <p>Did they expect Feng Xin to fucking recognize them by their handwriting or something? Honestly, he wasn’t even
        sure he’d be able to pick out Dianxia’s handwriting out of a lineup, and he was probably the person whose
        writing Feng Xin had seen the most of.</p>
      <p>Feng Xin resolved to ask who had sent the package in the communication array at a more reasonable hour.</p>
      <p>…But when morning came, he was immediately swept into discussions with the civil gods for the construction of
        his palace, and it slipped his mind until weeks later, when he was transferring his few belongings from the
        guest house to the newly built palace — by then it was so late that it felt like it would be more awkward to
        ask.</p>
      <p>…Well, they’d probably already forgotten they’d even sent it.</p>
