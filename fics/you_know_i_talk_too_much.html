<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Felix enjoys his job, he really does.</p><p>He‚Äôs unexpectedly good at being a lawyer, and most days he comes home tired but satisfied with his results. Sure, the research can be long and exhausting, but Felix‚Äôs thoroughness has always paid off at trial, and his sharp way of speaking and concise explanations are a boon in the courtroom too. So yes, he‚Äôs usually excellent at his job, and proud of it.¬†</p><p>Today, though, is shaping up to be a complete disaster.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs lunchtime. Felix should be using the hour that court is adjourned to go over his arguments again, but his mind cannot stop looping over all the things that have gone wrong today. Among said things are:¬†</p><ol>
<li>Waking up groggy and more tired than usual due to a very‚Ä¶distracting‚Ä¶dream,</li>
<li>Promptly tripping over one of his cats in the hallway,</li>
<li>Flying face first into the very naked chest of his roommate and best friend, Sylvain (coincidentally also the subject of said dream),</li>
<li>Blushing so hard that his forehead (still resting on Sylvain‚Äôs chest due to temporary lust-induced paralysis) was warm enough for Sylvain to comment that Felix seemed feverish, and was he feeling alright?</li>
<li>Practically running away from Sylvain and into the shower to avoid having to answer that question at all costs,</li>
<li>Spacing out so much during said shower that he forgot to use conditioner, resulting in extremely unprofessional frizz on a trial day,</li>
<li>Missing the train that would have gotten him to the courthouse early because he stayed too long at the coffee shop letting Annette distract him from the Sylvain issues,</li>
<li>Spilling said coffee on himself while on the next train,</li>
<li>Unintentionally scaring the tiny purple-haired girl next to him on the train (presumably with the look on his face after the coffee spill), causing her to scream and run away,</li>
<li>Having to use the dreaded ‚Äúbackup suit‚Äù which smelled funky, probably hadn‚Äôt been cleaned in months or years, and was on the verge of being too tight to comfortably breathe in,</li>
<li>Forgetting the Infinite Bag of Cables that was usually glued to him on trial days,</li>
<li>And giving his opening statement much more aggressively than usual due to massively compounding irritation at all of the above mistakes, visibly annoying the judge.</li>
</ol><p>After a whispered dressing-down from Lysithea on the importance of keeping his cool today, Felix let her take over the first round of arguments, and they managed to make it through the first half of the trial without further incident. It wasn‚Äôt going particularly well, especially with all the tech issues resulting from the lack of cables, but they‚Äôd turned things around in the second half of the day before.¬†</p><p>Unfortunately, Felix is still extremely uncomfortable and looks an absolute mess with his frizzy hair and the terrible too-tight suit, but there‚Äôs not much he can do about that with only an hour recess.¬†</p><p>He did at least manage to grab his lunch before his hasty departure this morning, and there‚Äôs a little bag of beef jerky underneath his sandwich that he knows he hadn‚Äôt packed himself. His cheeks grow warm without his permission, even though he knows Sylvain didn‚Äôt mean anything by it. He‚Äôs just being a good friend like he is to everyone.¬†</p><p>Turning on his phone for the first time since that morning, Felix is greeted with several texts and a voicemail. The voicemail was there when he woke up, he remembers, but today has been such a whirlwind he hasn‚Äôt had time to listen to it.</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Dimitri (7:13am): Good luck today! ü§û‚öñÔ∏è</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (7:37am): since u never answered my ? im going to assume ur not dying of a fever</p>
  <p>Sylvain (7:38am): text me when u get this though ok? just so i know u didn‚Äôt pass out in court or something</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Lysithea (8:26am): Hope you brought the cables, because the court sure didn‚Äôt provide any. If you‚Äôre not almost here you better hurry up.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Ashe (10:03am): (a picture of two cats curled up together from the shelter where he works - it‚Äôs very cute, and Felix saves it to his phone)</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Ingrid (11:58am): are you free for lunch this weekend? Dorothea and I are out of town for a week starting Monday, it‚Äôd be great to see you before then. Sylvain already said he‚Äôd be there ;) Dimitri too</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>Felix leaves all the texts unanswered for now, especially Ingrid‚Äôs with the infuriating winky face, and switches to the voicemail app. Surprisingly, it‚Äôs from Sylvain, despite the ridiculously early time stamp.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>(5:41am) ‚ÄúHey Fe. Wanted to say good luck today, not that you need it! I know you have your phone off because of trial and you probably won‚Äôt get this until it‚Äôs over, but the thought still counts, yeah? I‚Äôll make one of your faves for dinner and we can celebrate. See you later, or soon, in your time, haha!‚Äù</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs voice is rough and deep, like he just woke up when he called. It sends a shiver down Felix‚Äôs spine ‚Äì Sylvain‚Äôs voice is always nice when he‚Äôs being sincere, but hearing it like this feels illicit somehow. Like a stolen glimpse of waking up next to him.¬†</p><p>On that note‚Ä¶why was Sylvain up so early? Most nights he stays up late working on a project ‚Äì either for his editing job or his personal writing and art ‚Äì or, rarely these days, hanging out at the bar with Dorothea while she works. He‚Äôs usually never awake before Felix leaves.</p><p>Felix briefly entertains the fantasy that he set an early alarm just to leave Felix a message for later, but quickly dismisses it. Sylvain must have had something to do, otherwise he‚Äôd have gone back to bed‚Ä¶and he wouldn‚Äôt have been awake and walking around half naked when Felix woke up.¬†</p><p>At that thought, Felix feels a fresh wave of embarrassment over the events of this morning.</p><p>It‚Äôs not like seeing Sylvain shirtless is a rarity at their apartment. In fact, he runs so warm that if he‚Äôs not in some state of undress or another there‚Äôs a good chance he‚Äôs getting sick.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs just different to have a faceful of your best friend‚Äôs chest when you‚Äôd just been dreaming of biting marks into it, loving how he sounds as he moans shamelessly into your ear, gasping your name when you slide down to take his cock down your throat all at once.¬†</p><p>And, as Annette said this morning in her usual astute extrapolation of Felix‚Äôs feelings, it‚Äôs different when you‚Äôve been in love with said friend for most of your life, and he most definitely does not feel the same way, so he cannot, under any circumstances, find out about your feelings or everything will be ruined.</p><p>Felix definitely does not want things to be ruined.</p><p>There‚Äôs a reason hardly anyone else has put up with him for this long, but Sylvain‚Äôs never shown signs of truly being tired of him. Even when they fight, it‚Äôs not for long these days.</p><p>It seems forever ago now, when Felix had been worried that Sylvain moving in might spell the end of their friendship if things went awry.¬†</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt a planned decision ‚Äì Sylvain had just showed up at his door one night with a black eye and a duffel bag, looking exhausted. He didn‚Äôt have to say a word for Felix to know what had happened.¬†</p><p>Felix took off work the next day, called Dimitri and Ingrid as backup, and stormed Antoine Gautier‚Äôs house for the rest of Sylvain‚Äôs things, barely restraining himself from returning the favor of a black eye.</p><p>While Felix ransacked the house, Dimitri‚Äôs height and aura of rage were enough to keep Sylvain‚Äôs father from interfering, and Ingrid was able to quietly persuade his mother to hand over any important documents. By the end of the day, there was no reason Sylvain should ever have to return to that house again.¬†</p><p>Sylvain slept for most of the first week, emerging only for food and to apologize, despite how often Felix insisted there wasn‚Äôt anything to apologize for.</p><p>What was the point of one man and two cats living in a three-bedroom apartment if not to provide a place for friends to stay when they need it?</p><p>While he was secretly pleased that Sylvain had come to him, even though any of his friends would have happily put him up, Felix didn‚Äôt know if he could realistically offer a long-term living arrangement without ruining things between them.</p><p>He didn‚Äôt think he could handle Sylvain bringing his one night stands home with him ‚Äì but suspected he‚Äôd be equally as upset if Sylvain didn‚Äôt come home for the night. There was no way to win except to tell Sylvain to stop fucking around, and Felix knew that wasn‚Äôt something a friend had the right to ask.¬†</p><p>Thankfully, he never actually had to.</p><p>A few weeks in, Sylvain offhandedly mentioned his plans to go on a date over the weekend. Felix‚Äôs discomfort (but hopefully not his jealousy) must have been written all over his face, because Sylvain immediately backpedaled, claiming he‚Äôd ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù a ‚Äúwork deadline‚Äù, and the matter had never been brought up again.¬†</p><p>And Sylvain is actually an excellent roommate on all of the following counts:</p><ol>
<li>Felix‚Äôs cats, Spook and Lumi, both love him despite not being very sociable types,</li>
<li>he doesn‚Äôt mind Felix‚Äôs eccentric decorations (most notably the rack of swords),</li>
<li>he keeps the apartment cleaner than even Felix would,</li>
<li>he buys groceries and does chores without being asked, and</li>
<li>he uses his habit of incessantly texting Felix for good, keeping him up to date on any and all roommate matters. Now Felix gets messages of ‚Äúpicking up litter at the store, do u need anything‚Äù alongside Sylvain‚Äôs usual inane thoughts, like ‚Äúwhat if some animals need glasses but we‚Äôll never know???? :(((‚Äù¬†¬†</li>
<li>‚Ä¶He‚Äôs also a decent cook, though that‚Äôs just a nice bonus.</li>
</ol><p>Other than being constantly flustered by Sylvain‚Äôs presence (which is entirely his own problem), Felix has no complaints.</p><p>Of course they fight sometimes ‚Äì Felix‚Äôs sharp tongue and Sylvain‚Äôs self-destructive tendencies practically ensure it ‚Äì but to Felix‚Äôs surprise, seeing each other every day actually makes it easier to work things out.</p><p>It‚Äôs an entirely different experience from living with Ingrid in college, before his father had ‚Äúgifted‚Äù him this apartment. Not that she was a bad roommate. They just weren‚Äôt suited to live together, both too picky about conflicting things, and both too stubborn for arguments to truly be resolved.</p><p>With Sylvain‚Ä¶it feels like he‚Äôs meant to be here. After only six months of living together, it‚Äôs hard for Felix to imagine their apartment without Sylvain in it.¬†</p><p>And as he insisted to Annette this morning, Sylvain discovering how Felix feels about him would almost certainly make things awkward and uncomfortable, which would eventually make Sylvain want to move out.¬†</p><p>Felix definitely does not want him to move out. Possibly ever.</p><p>So, Sylvain can absolutely never find out why Felix has been so weird today.¬†</p><p>‚Ä¶To that end, Felix needs to text him ‚Äì and everyone else ‚Äì back before he has to go back to court.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Dimitri (7:13am): Good luck today! ü§û‚öñÔ∏è¬†</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:48pm): Thanks. Tell Claude his advice on the case wasn‚Äôt bad.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (7:37am): since u never answered my ? im going to assume ur not dying of a fever</p>
  <p>Sylvain (7:38am): text me when u get this though ok? just so i know u didn‚Äôt pass out in court or something</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:50pm): I‚Äôm not dying. Just didn‚Äôt sleep well. Thanks for the message and the beef jerky. See you tonight.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Ingrid (11:58am): are you free for lunch this weekend? Dorothea and I are out of town for a week starting Monday, it‚Äôd be great to see you before then. Sylvain already said he‚Äôd be there ;) Dimitri too</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:53pm): Sure. Just text me time and location.<em> ¬† </em></p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>Sylvain is the only one who responds immediately.¬†¬†</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (12:54pm): see u tonight!!!</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>The triple exclamation points make Felix smile despite himself. He decides there‚Äôs no harm in listening to Sylvain‚Äôs voicemail one more time before he heads back inside.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>The second half of the trial goes better than the first, but it‚Äôs still hard to predict what the results will be. They‚Äôll just have to wait until the judge issues the decision, which is always the easiest part for Felix and the hardest part for his clients. He‚Äôs done all he can do for now, and he‚Äôs frankly desperate to get home, out of this suit, into the shower, and onto the couch to watch a movie with Sylvain.¬†</p><p>The train ride seemingly takes forever, and Felix isn‚Äôt the only one who hates his suit. The other passengers give him a wide berth. He can‚Äôt blame them ‚Äì he‚Äôs gotten desensitized to the smell, but he‚Äôs sure it‚Äôs just as bad as this morning, if not worse since he‚Äôs been wearing it all day and it‚Äôs really exceptionally tight, no breathing room at all.¬†</p><p>When Felix gets home, Sylvain‚Äôs in the kitchen wearing an apron.</p><p>‚Ä¶And Felix‚Äôs heart almost stops, because from the doorway it looks like he‚Äôs wearing nothing <em> but </em> the apron.¬†</p><p>Fortunately, the click of the door closing alerts Sylvain to Felix‚Äôs presence, and he steps out from behind the counter as he moves to greet Felix, revealing that he is at least wearing pants.¬†</p><p>Not so fortunately, Sylvain has noticed the state Felix is in and appears to be frozen in place, ogling at him with his mouth hanging slightly open.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúFelix ‚Äì that suit ‚Äì it‚Äôs ‚Äì that isn‚Äôt one of your regular ones, right? You look‚Ä¶I mean‚Ä¶wow,‚Äù Sylvain says after a long moment. His face is flushed from cooking over the stove.¬†</p><p>Well. Felix knew he was a mess, but if he was making Sylvain speechless it must be worse than he thought. ‚ÄúI know, it‚Äôs ridiculous and I look terrible. I had to borrow it after I spilled coffee on my blue one this morning,‚Äù he says.¬†</p><p>Sylvain looks taken aback. ‚ÄúNo, Fe, that‚Äôs not what I ‚Äì ugh, never mind. I‚Äôm just glad you‚Äôre home.‚Äù He‚Äôs unfrozen now, angling for a hug, which ‚Äì absolutely not, not when Felix smells this bad.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúNo hugs,‚Äù he says, sidestepping Sylvain‚Äôs grabby hands. ‚ÄúI need to take a shower ‚Äì can dinner wait a bit?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs still got to cook for a while longer,‚Äù Sylvain says, ducking back to the kitchen to check the timer. ‚ÄúTwenty-three minutes if you want it hot and fresh.‚Äù He grins, waggling his eyebrows and pulling a tiny smile from Felix. ‚ÄúSooooo‚Ä¶hugs later?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Felix says, not meaning it in the slightest, and swiftly turns in the direction of the bathroom before another damned blush can give him away.¬†</p><p>The shower bleeds away the tension of the day, and this time he makes sure not to forget the conditioner.</p><p>As he lets it sit for an extra minute to combat the tangles, he remembers suddenly that Sylvain used to ask to braid his hair, years ago, when Felix was still immensely prickly and more angry about his crush on Sylvain than anything. He understands why Sylvain stopped asking, but still. He probably wouldn‚Äôt say no now, if Sylvain asked.¬†</p><p>But that‚Äôs just as much a fantasy as waking up next to him in the mornings ‚Äì best not to think of it when Sylvain is waiting for him in the kitchen now.¬†</p><p>They settle in on the couch for an episode of the sci-fi show they‚Äôve been watching together, and Felix plops his feet in Sylvain‚Äôs lap, an apology for the earlier hug denial.¬†</p><p>The curry is extremely delicious and very spicy ‚Äì Felix thinks maybe a little too spicy for Sylvain, as his face is red the whole time they eat. Sylvain asks how the trial went, and Felix asks him about his day in turn, and they stay up talking until Felix is nodding off on the couch, most of the length of his legs now on top of Sylvain‚Äôs.¬†</p><p>All in all, it‚Äôs almost a perfect Friday night, and Felix tries to tell Sylvain so as they slouch off to their respective rooms. ‚ÄúSylvain‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúYes, sleepyhead?‚Äù</p><p>Felix wants to scoff at the endearment, but Sylvain sounds so soft he can‚Äôt bring himself to ruin the moment.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúThis‚Ä¶was good. Thanks,‚Äù he mumbles instead. It‚Äôs not enough, but he doesn‚Äôt know how to say more without saying too much.</p><p>‚ÄúAww, glad you liked it,‚Äù Sylvain says, evidently thinking Felix meant just the curry. ‚ÄúI made it extra spicy just for you.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúNo, not the curry. I mean ‚Äì I liked the curry ‚Äì but‚Ä¶everything else, too.‚Äù¬†</p><p>Sylvain looks baffled. Felix must be too tired to make any sense, because there‚Äôs suddenly a warm arm around his shoulders, and Sylvain is steering him into his room and onto his bed. ‚ÄúYou had a long day, huh? Get some sleep. I‚Äôm gonna tell Ingrid we should do lunch on Sunday instead, so sleep in for once, okay?‚Äù</p><p>Felix hums in acknowledgement.</p><p>‚ÄúG‚Äônight, Fe. Sweet dreams.‚Äù</p><p>And Felix does indeed have sweet dreams.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>When he wakes, it‚Äôs to the feeling of Sylvain‚Äôs lips on his neck, the line of Sylvain‚Äôs body pressed up against his back and his cock pressing deliciously into his ass.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúMorning, Felix,‚Äù Sylvain says, voice all rumbly and rough with sleep. Fuck, it‚Äôs even hotter to hear him like this when he‚Äôs breathing the words right into Felix‚Äôs ear.</p><p>He palms Felix‚Äôs cock through his boxers and lazily grinds against him, and the combination of Sylvain‚Äôs voice and his touch have Felix hard and aching though he‚Äôs hardly even awake yet.¬†</p><p>He rolls over to express his appreciation with a kiss, pulling Sylvain flush against him again. The broken moan Sylvain makes when Felix not-so-gently bites at his lip and pulls is‚Ä¶Goddess, it‚Äôs the hottest thing Felix has ever heard.¬†</p><p>Sylvain is so vocal, and Felix can‚Äôt get enough of it.</p><p>Every touch draws out a different noise or gasp of Felix‚Äôs name, and he‚Äôs determined to hear them all, pressing his lips and hands to every inch of Sylvain‚Äôs skin.</p><p>His voice is like a live wire straight to Felix‚Äôs dick ‚Äì he‚Äôs already so close to coming and Sylvain has hardly done anything but writhe under his touch.</p><p>Sylvain needs to catch up. Felix wraps a hand around him, delighting in how Sylvain‚Äôs hips fly up and he nearly shouts, and Felix feels‚Ä¶a sudden heavy pressure on his chest?</p><p>The pressure shifts and turns into four, sharper pressure points, and Felix is pulled out of sleep and into reality with a gasp.¬†</p><p>Lumi is standing on his chest. Now that he‚Äôs awake, she pushes her face up against his chin, purring softly, unbothered by his heaving breaths as he recovers from the dream.¬†</p><p>This is the most vivid one he‚Äôs had yet‚Ä¶.damn that voicemail for getting him so fixated on Sylvain‚Äôs voice.</p><p>He probably would have come in his sleep if Lumi hadn‚Äôt woken him, and he doesn‚Äôt know whether to be irritated at the interruption or grateful she saved him from cleaning up the mess.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs only 7am when Felix checks the time. He‚Äôs hardly slept in at all, and Lumi apparently woke him for cuddles, not food, so it should be fine to stay in bed a while longer.</p><p>Spook isn‚Äôt in his room, so he‚Äôs probably with Sylvain. Felix uncharitably hopes Spook will stand on Sylvain‚Äôs chest and give him a similar rude awakening. It‚Äôs only fair since Sylvain <em> is </em> the cause of his predicament, after all.¬†</p><p>Sylvain probably won‚Äôt be up until 10, and Felix is feeling sleepy again now that his breathing has evened out and Lumi has settled herself on his chest. Might as well go back to sleep. If he‚Äôs lucky, maybe he‚Äôll get a sequel to that dream.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>The sound of rain on the windows wakes Felix up gradually. No run today, he supposes. If it was only sprinkling he wouldn‚Äôt mind, but it sounds like it‚Äôs coming down hard enough that he‚Äôd be instantly drenched just stepping out the door.¬†</p><p>Stretching, he checks the time on his phone, and shit, it‚Äôs already almost noon. He really must have been tired from yesterday. There‚Äôs a text from Ingrid confirming their lunch meetup tomorrow, and he shoots her a quick thumbs up before getting dressed.¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs warm coffee waiting for him in the kitchen, and an abandoned mug on the counter, still full to the brim. Felix snorts in amusement. Sylvain must have made it hours ago, judging by how cold it is, and then gotten distracted and forgotten about it. He dumps it down the drain ‚Äì microwaving it would only make it disgusting ‚Äì and sets about fixing two fresh mugs: black with a splash of cream for himself, and Sylvain‚Äôs preferred combination of almost more milk than coffee and an ungodly amount of sugar.</p><p>Sylvain is splayed over the couch, glasses low on his nose, and absolutely engrossed in the manuscript he‚Äôs reading. The coffee mug clinks against the glass of the side table as Felix sets it down ‚Äì apparently loud enough to startle him, because he jumps, letting out an undignified squawk.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúAck! Felix! I didn‚Äôt know you were up,‚Äù he exclaims, scrambling to collect the papers scattered in his surprise.¬†</p><p>Felix bends down to help. ‚ÄúJust woke up actually.‚Äù¬†¬†</p><p>The pages are thankfully numbered, so Felix doesn‚Äôt feel too bad for startling him ‚Äì instead, he takes this moment of distraction to fully appreciate how cute Sylvain is like this.¬†</p><p>Between the glasses, bedhead, faint scruff on his chin, and the rumpled pajamas Felix had gifted him years ago, he‚Äôs the picture of lazy domesticity.</p><p>Felix can easily imagine himself in an alternate timeline ‚Äì one where he‚Äôd be allowed to pull Sylvain close, slide his hands up under his shirt, and drop them both back on the sofa. Maybe Sylvain would even read aloud to him as they cuddle.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúEverything okay?‚Äù</p><p>Ugh, he‚Äôs been staring too long. ‚ÄúYou must be enjoying this one if I scared you so easily,‚Äù Felix says, hoping it‚Äôs enough to dodge the question.¬†</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs eyes light up. ‚ÄúYeah! It‚Äôs one of Bernie‚Äôs, I always lose track of time when I‚Äôm reading her stuff.‚Äù He launches into an enthusiastic description of the plot and the suggestions he‚Äôs considering, and Felix is content to listen, sipping his coffee to hide a small smile.¬†</p><p>They spend the rest of the afternoon quietly on the couch, Felix playing games on his Switch and Sylvain reading and annotating Bernie‚Äôs book, occasionally breaking the comfortable silence to work through his thoughts aloud.¬†</p><p>After a while, Sylvain starts absently brushing his fingers along Felix‚Äôs bare calves. Felix can‚Äôt tell whether it‚Äôs just fidgeting or if Sylvain realizes what he‚Äôs doing, but either way it‚Äôs driving him crazy, sending shivers of heat down his spine.¬†</p><p>Irritatingly, Felix can‚Äôt suppress the blush that blooms over his face and neck as Sylvain‚Äôs casual touches get him increasingly flustered. His cheeks feel bright enough to serve as an extra reading lamp ‚Äì it‚Äôs honestly surprising Sylvain hasn‚Äôt noticed and started in on the teasing yet.</p><p>Felix finally sighs once, loudly, to see if it will get Sylvain to stop, but there‚Äôs not even a hint of a reaction. Since moving his legs away is obviously out of the question, Felix supposes he has no choice but to accept his fate.</p><p>At least he‚Äôd placed a pillow on his lap to prop up the Switch before this infuriatingly arousing nonsense started.¬†</p><p>Spook and Lumi rescue him at their usual 4pm nap time, demanding cuddles from both their humans, and by 5 it‚Äôs time for Sylvain to head out for his weekly meeting with Bernie.¬†</p><p>Felix has never met her, but she‚Äôs Sylvain‚Äôs favorite client, and the only one he meets on weekends these days. If it were anyone else, Felix might start to worry Sylvain was slipping back into bad habits, overworking to compensate for his imagined failures, but he always comes back so energized from his meetings with Bernie that Felix has to like her on principle. She seems to be genuinely good for his mental health.</p><p>Bernie‚Äôs Saturday meetings are also the only time Felix is alone in the house on weekends, and today he desperately needs those few hours of privacy.¬†</p><p>A run on the treadmill downstairs after Sylvain leaves unfortunately does nothing to calm Felix down. He‚Äôs out of breath and panting within five minutes. It‚Äôs not from exertion ‚Äì he‚Äôs just so pent up that all the blood in his body has rushed to his cock, and every brush of his clothes against his skin feels like Sylvain‚Äôs gentle touches, teasing but never enough.¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs nothing for it but to deal with his arousal directly. Heading back upstairs, he locks the door of his bedroom and breathlessly falls into bed, one hand already reaching into his underwear.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs been ages since Felix has touched himself properly. On weeknights he‚Äôs usually tired enough to fall asleep immediately, and with Sylvain around he never wants to risk more than something quick and quiet in the shower.¬†</p><p>Something quick and quiet is not going to be enough tonight.¬†</p><p>Stroking himself feels good, his hips jerking up into the touch, but there‚Äôs definitely something missing. Felix wants something closer to what he‚Äôs been dreaming of.</p><p>‚Ä¶He wants to hear Sylvain‚Äôs voice.¬†</p><p>Obviously, that‚Äôs not possible, so he‚Äôll have to settle for his imagination. Sylvain‚Äôs almost definitely good at dirty talk ‚Äì he probably never shuts up in bed. Felix can‚Äôt suppress a moan just thinking about Sylvain saying his name, all coarse and low.¬†¬†</p><p>Unfortunately, Felix himself is terrible at dirty talk. He never has any idea what to say, and he‚Äôs blanking on what else Sylvain might say, too. Felix‚Äôs name, ‚Äòyes‚Äô, ‚Äòplease‚Äô, ‚Äòharder‚Äô are all good options ‚Äì but what else?</p><p>Vaguely, he remembers Annette mentioning a forum where people uploaded audio of themselves talking. Apparently Mercedes used to post ASMR audios there, and Annette got so flustered telling him about it that he always suspected the other posts on the forum were more explicit than she was expecting.¬†</p><p>It couldn‚Äôt hurt to check it out.</p><p>Felix still has plenty of time before Sylvain will be home, and he‚Äôs feeling weirdly invested in finding a realistic way for imaginary Sylvain to take him apart with his voice. He‚Äôll be embarrassed about it tomorrow, he knows, but right now there‚Äôs no blood left in his brain to worry about that.</p><p>It takes a while to scroll back far enough through his text conversation with Annette to find the link ‚Äì it was around three years ago they talked about this, back when he had just started his first job as a lawyer, fresh out of school and stressed beyond belief.</p><p>Mercedes‚Äô ASMR posts were supposed to help him relax, Annette had said ‚Äì they worked miracles for her own stress levels, which she had insisted were higher than Felix‚Äôs, so they‚Äôd be ‚Äúsure to fix him right up!‚Äù</p><p>As he clicks on the link and listens to the first few seconds of Mercedes‚Äô post out of curiosity, he immediately remembers why Annette‚Äôs suggestion had definitely <em> not </em> fixed him right up.</p><p>Mercedes has a nice enough voice, but it hardly matters because her ASMR technique involves whispering breathily directly into the mic, causing a tickling sensation on the back of Felix‚Äôs neck that makes him intensely uncomfortable.</p><p>Also, Annette and Mercedes weren‚Äôt dating back then, but now that they are, Felix feels like he‚Äôs intruding on something that should belong to Annette alone.¬†</p><p>Quickly, he backs out of her post and into the main page of the forum. As he suspected, the majority of the posts seem to be explicit, with a few ‚Äúcalming‚Äù posts few and far between.¬†</p><p>Good. Surely there‚Äôs something here that will sound enough like Sylvain‚Äôs manner of speaking for his purposes.</p><p>A large majority of the posts seem to be from women ‚Äì that won‚Äôt help Felix too much in imagining Sylvain, so he starts by filtering those out. It should also sound like something Sylvain could say to <em> him </em> specifically, so he searches for only posts marked ‚Äúfor men‚Äù or ‚Äúfor anyone‚Äù. The number of results is in the hundreds instead of thousands now, which feels much more manageable.¬†</p><p>There are a couple posts that catch his eye, but he ends up closing out of them quickly ‚Äì some of the voices are grating, and the others have such terrible acting that Felix thinks even <em> he </em> could do better.</p><p>Finally, after going through two full pages of results, he stumbles upon a description that almost seems too perfect.¬†</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>@galoot_of_ill_repute ‚Äì [M4A] [Script Fill] Will you feel better if you fuck me? [Domestic] [Seduction] [Teasing] [Dirty Talk] [Body Worship] [Moaning] [Anal]</p>
  <p>u had a rough day at work and want to take it out on my ass ;) does it count as a script fill if i wrote the script myself? hope u enjoy ;)</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs exactly what Felix was looking for. The domestic tag isn‚Äôt something he knew he wanted, but it‚Äôs sending his pulse through the roof, and the description even sounds like Sylvain could have written it.¬†</p><p>Heart pounding, Felix clicks on the link to the audio.¬†</p><p>It takes a minute to load, and then ‚Äì¬†</p><p>‚ÄúHey guys. I‚Äôm back again, thought it‚Äôd be fun to read my own script this time.‚Äù</p><p>Oh holy Sothis, mother of all fucking creatures.¬†</p><p>It sounded like Sylvain‚Äôs writing because it <em> is </em> Sylvain.¬†</p><p>Blood thrumming in his ears, Felix almost flings his phone off the bed in his rush to hit the pause button.</p><p>His hands are shaking so badly he accidentally clicks an ad, but he hardly hears the too-loud and overly peppy voice that cuts Sylvain off, cheerfully listing potential side effects of some drug or another.¬†¬†</p><p>Fuck. Shit. This is ‚Äì this is so much more than Felix was expecting.¬†</p><p>He desperately <em> wants </em> to listen to it, his entire body already shaking in anticipation, cock throbbing in time with his rapid pulse.</p><p>But can he ‚Äì should he ‚Äì?</p><p>Part of Felix ‚Äì the honorable part, probably ‚Äì is uncomfortable with the idea. Even stumbling upon this by accident feels like an invasion of Sylvain‚Äôs privacy. And like Mercedes‚Äô audios, Felix knows this is something that obviously wasn‚Äôt meant for him ‚Äì listening to it would be intruding somewhere he doesn‚Äôt belong.</p><p>But he‚Äôs never been terribly concerned with honor, so it‚Äôs not surprising that the larger, hornier part of him is insisting that it‚Äôs fair game. Sylvain chose to post it publicly, free for the whole internet to find ‚Äì he had to know that literally anyone might listen to these audios. Maybe that was even part of the appeal?¬†</p><p>Also the whole point of this forum is to help people relieve tension, right? If being incredibly, unbelievably, devastatingly turned on counts as tension, then Felix is about to snap at any moment.¬†</p><p>Not to mention it would surely be worse for present-day Sylvain to come home and find Felix in this state than it would be for him to get off to past-Sylvain‚Äôs voice and just get it out of his system.¬†</p><p>Mind made up, Felix divests himself of all his clothes ‚Äì he was already sweating through them, taking them off later would just be a distraction from giving Sylvain his full attention ‚Äì and settles into a comfortable position on the bed.¬†</p><p>Rewinding to the beginning of the audio, he sucks in a shaky breath, sets the phone on the pillow by his head, and presses play.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúHey guys. I‚Äôm back again, thought it‚Äôd be fun to read my own script this time,‚Äù Sylvain says into his ear.</p><p>‚ÄúI think I said this in my last post, but I‚Äôve been, uh, super tense lately, haha.‚Äù He sounds almost nervous at this, voice wavering a bit, and Felix can picture him sheepishly rubbing the back of his neck.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúSo I wanted to try something new today, which will hopefully help with that, and also be fun for you guys‚Äì‚Äù Sylvain‚Äôs voice fades out for a second, then back in. ‚Äú‚ÄìAnd that is, well I know you can‚Äôt see it, but I just got out a shiny new dildo, and I‚Äôm gonna fuck myself with it when we get to that part.‚Äù</p><p>Felix can‚Äôt contain a startled moan, hips bucking up into nothing, hands twisting in the sheets.</p><p>Imagining Sylvain in this very apartment, only a wall away from Felix, riding a dildo‚Ä¶if he doesn‚Äôt keep his hands occupied, away from his body, he‚Äôll absolutely come before Sylvain‚Äôs even started.</p><p>‚ÄúExtra realism, yeah?‚Äù Sylvain continues, laughing a little breathlessly. ‚ÄúAnyway. I‚Äôll stop rambling now and get to it.‚Äù</p><p>A brief pause, then there‚Äôs the sound of a door opening and closing, and the jangle of keys tossed on a table.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúHi, sweetheart!‚Äù Sylvain‚Äôs voice calls out, a little distant, then closer again as he continues. ‚ÄúC‚Äômere, let me hug you. Mmmm‚Ä¶.I missed you, y‚Äôknow. How was your day?‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs voice is soft and low, the way it gets when he‚Äôs serious about what he‚Äôs saying.</p><p>Felix has never heard him sound this genuine around anyone he‚Äôs actually dated, so he must either be an excellent actor, or he‚Äôs imagining someone he genuinely cares for as he talks.¬†</p><p>The thought makes Felix‚Äôs chest tighten, bitter jealousy threatening to cloud his mood, but he quickly and deliberately dismisses it. Even if this is something he can never have for real, he can at least indulge himself in the fantasy for one night.¬†</p><p>After a brief pause, presumably for the listener to fill in the words of his imaginary partner, Sylvain continues.</p><p>‚ÄúOof. That sounds rough, hon. Glad it‚Äôs Friday so you can have a break from all that‚Ä¶You did seem a little tense just now. What can I do to take your mind off it? I could run a bath, maybe some candles, music‚Ä¶I‚Äôll wash your hair, press my fingers into your scalp, run them down your neck just the way you like it.‚Äù</p><p>Felix shivers. With how soft his voice has gotten and the way Felix can hear every breath, it feels like Sylvain is directly behind him, murmuring into his ear.¬†</p><p>Having Sylvain‚Äôs hands in his hair sounds incredible. Felix can‚Äôt help but slide one of his own hands up towards his braid, pulling the tie off and undoing the plaits so his hair is spread loose over the pillow.¬†</p><p>Experimentally, he threads his fingers gently through his hair and down his neck like Sylvain says. It feels nice, relaxing. Definitely something he‚Äôd enjoy in a warm bath.¬†¬†</p><p>Another pause for the illusion of conversation, then Sylvain continues. ‚ÄúHmm, no? Not in the mood for that tonight? Then‚Ä¶how about a massage? Goddess, I‚Äôd love to get my hands on you, cover you in oil‚Ä¶mmm‚Ä¶and just press and press into you‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>He‚Äôs starting to sound affected, voice getting raspy and breath coming faster. Felix is right there with him.</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶I wanna knead your shoulders, down your back, that perfect dip at the base of your spine. Skip down to your feet and move up and up, take my time rubbing your incredible legs, and then, <em> then </em> I can get a handful of your tight ass. Hah ‚Äì wanna get you moaning from how deep I massage you before I flip you over‚Ä¶I bet there‚Äôs tension in your chest too, your arms and wrists and hands‚Ä¶I wanna take all the time I need to get you limp and slick and boneless beneath me.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs voice is almost a physical thing, a heat moving over Felix‚Äôs body in time with his words.</p><p>It‚Äôs a good thing the massage isn‚Äôt real though, because Felix is sure ‚Äòlimp‚Äô would be an understatement if it were. He‚Äôd simply dissolve into a puddle of goo on the bed under that much attention from Sylvain‚Äôs hands.</p><p>Then comes something that Felix is entirely unprepared for ‚Äì soft kissing sounds, wet and messy, interspersed with little hums ‚Äì and Felix can almost <em> feel </em> Sylvain‚Äôs lips on his neck, soft and sweet and smiling, the vibration of each hum sending hot shivers down every nerve.¬†</p><p>It‚Äôs so much, too much, and Felix has to shoot a hand down to his cock, squeezing it firmly around the base with a groan. Already he‚Äôs teetering on the edge, close to coming though he‚Äôs hardly touched himself.</p><p>Goddess, he‚Äôs a mess.</p><p>‚ÄúSo? How about it?‚Äù says Sylvain, after a torturous minute of kissing.¬†</p><p><em> Goddess, yes </em>, Felix thinks, but apparently Sylvain‚Äôs imaginary partner doesn‚Äôt feel the same. ‚ÄúSure, babe, we can save that for tomorrow. I‚Äôll be looking forward to it.‚Äù¬†¬†</p><p>Felix can hear the teasing smile in Sylvain‚Äôs voice as he continues, pictures the crinkles around Sylvain‚Äôs eyes.</p><p>‚ÄúYou said you had something else in mind? Care to share?‚Äù¬†</p><p>A long silence, then Sylvain gasps, sharp and surprised‚Äì ‚ÄúAhhhh, hah‚Ä¶fuck babe, yes, of course! You know I always want you inside me.‚Äù¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs a thump, like he‚Äôs fallen back against a wall, or thrown his head back in pleasure. ‚ÄúNeed you to fuck me ‚Äì ngh ‚Äì rough and fast today, take it all out on me‚Ä¶but if you ‚Äì haaaaah ‚Äì keep touching me‚Ä¶like that‚Ä¶we‚Äôre not gonna make it to the bedroom.‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs no way Felix‚Äôs dreams or imagination could have conjured anything as incredible as this.¬†</p><p>He can tell Sylvain‚Äôs started stroking himself as he talks ‚Äì the breaks in his voice are completely genuine ‚Äì and the way he seems to say everything on his mind, yet bites out the words like it‚Äôs an effort to focus on them, is the hottest thing Felix has ever heard.¬†</p><p>More kissing sounds, shuffling, and then the unmistakable rustling of sheets as Sylvain falls into bed.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúMm, you taste amazing. I could kiss you all day. But you‚Äôre so eager for this, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù Sylvain says, managing to sound cocky despite the thick arousal in his voice. ‚ÄúHave you been thinking about fucking me all day? I bet you have, your hands are <em> everywhere </em>, fuuuuck, fe‚Äì feels amazing.‚Äù¬†</p><p>Felix <em> has </em> been thinking about fucking Sylvain, perhaps not all day today, but at the very least once a day, every day, for the past ten years. Sylvain fucking him, too ‚Äì he isn‚Äôt particularly picky.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúNeed your clothes off, wanna touch you too - ohhh fuck, you feel incredible‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†</p><p>The sliding sounds of fabric against skin make Felix shiver. He should have waited to undress with Sylvain ‚Äì all the noises make it so, so easy to imagine Sylvain is actually here with him, and it‚Äôs even more vivid when he can follow along with Sylvain‚Äôs words.</p><p>There‚Äôs no way Felix can keep his hands fisted in the sheets a minute longer.</p><p>He still desperately wants Sylvain‚Äôs hands in his hair, so he slides one of his own up into the thick waves, pulling a little at the roots. His other hand he allows to roam his chest, touching lightly, teasingly, tweaking his nipples and arching up into the touch.</p><p>Imagining how different, how much better Sylvain‚Äôs bigger hands would feel drags a broken moan from his lungs.</p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so beautiful, you know that? I love your blush, love how it spills all the way down your chest and your ears get so red‚Ä¶mmmm, love knowing I‚Äôm the one who got you so flustered.‚Äù Sylvain‚Äôs voice is soft, heartfelt, emotional. Felix finds himself flushing at the clear affection, feeling an urge to turn away even though there‚Äôs no one here to witness his embarrassment.¬†¬†</p><p>‚ÄúIf you weren‚Äôt feeling so impatient I‚Äôd have to insist on kissing ‚Äì every ‚Äì single ‚Äì inch ‚Äì of that ‚Äì perfect ‚Äì skin,‚Äù Sylvain continues, punctuating each word with a kiss.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúWanna run ‚Äì my tongue ‚Äì over all your scars ‚Äì leave marks ‚Äì on your collarbone‚Ä¶mmmm, fuck, want you to press on the bruises later and remember you‚Äôre all <em> mine </em> .‚Äù The last word comes out in a possessive growl, and Felix‚Äôs dick <em> throbs, </em>jumping against his belly.¬†</p><p>If he goes another second without touching himself he‚Äôs going to explode.</p><p>He‚Äôs absolutely dripping with pre-come when he finally, finally takes himself in hand. Overwhelmed with sensation, he can‚Äôt restrain a gasp, hips flying off the bed and mind blissfully blank of everything but Sylvain. The glide of his palm is so slick and wet that it takes all of his self control to keep himself from fucking up into his hand with abandon.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine, and I‚Äôm yours, and I want you to ‚Äì ngh ‚Äì fuck me so hard‚Ä¶so hard I‚Äôm ruined for anyone‚Äôs shape but yours.‚Äù¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs the click of a cap in the background, the slick, sticky sound of lube, and then Sylvain nearly shouts. ‚ÄúAhhh ‚Äì hah, fuck! Just your finger, feels ‚Äì ngh! So good already‚Ä¶come on, open me up, ohhhh fuck, yes, just like that! Give me another, I want it, please‚Ä¶nghhh, yes!‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain is panting, losing control as his voice cracks over each moan. If he sounds this wrecked from just his fingers, the noises he makes when he starts fucking himself with the dildo are going to give Felix a heart attack.¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs really only so much teasing Felix can take, and he‚Äôs rapidly nearing his limit. Thankfully, Sylvain seems to be feeling the same, because ‚Äì in a turn of events that leaves Felix‚Äôs mouth dry ‚Äì he starts <em> begging </em> to be fucked.</p><p>‚ÄúOh Goddess you‚Äôre stretching me so good, so perfect ‚Äì ahh! Ah, ah‚Ä¶m‚Äôready, want you now, fuck, please! Need you‚Ä¶need you inside, mmmmfuck! I can‚Äôt, need you to fill me up, please, please, fe‚Äì, ngh, feel you right there ‚Äì yes, inside ‚Äì ahhhhh!‚Äù</p><p>The slick sound of Sylvain pushing the dildo inside himself is clearly audible, and Felix nearly comes on the spot, stars in his vision and gasping for air.¬†</p><p>Every stuttered moan makes him jerk up into his hand <em> hard </em>, automatically, like Sylvain‚Äôs voice has his body under a spell. If he closes his eyes, he can see Sylvain riding him, head thrown back in ecstasy and flushed beautifully, cock bouncing as Felix fills him, over and over.</p><p>‚ÄúMm, hah, love how you feel inside me, s‚Äôperfect, like you were made for me ‚Äì ahhh! Yes! Fuck, ngh, faster! Rail me, wanna feel you so deep, wanna feel you for days ‚Äì hah, ah ‚Äì please! Right there, oh, oh my fuck ‚Äì yes!‚Äù¬†</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs hardly making any sense now, moaning and gasping at each audible thrust, and Felix can‚Äôt help but to time his own strokes to match, slamming up into his hand at each wet squelch like it‚Äôs <em> his </em> cock inside Sylvain, like it‚Äôs <em> him </em> taking Sylvain apart so thoroughly he can hardly speak.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúAhhhh, fuck, m‚Äôclose! Ngh, want you ‚Äì ahh ‚Äì to come in‚Äì, inside me! Oh yes, oh fuck, please ‚Äì hah ‚Äì come with me! Mm, need you, love you, fe‚Äìfuck! Close, please, yes ‚Äì ah, ah, ah, ahhhhhh!‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain sounds so good, so perfect, so <em> wrecked </em>. But as incredible as his moans are, it‚Äôs that choked out ‚Äúlove you‚Äù that pushes Felix over the edge.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúSyl, yes ‚Äì Syl, oh fuck, ah, ahhh, Sylvain, Syl-vaaain!‚Äù he gasps, and then he‚Äôs shuddering, coming the hardest he ever has in his life, in sync with Sylvain‚Äôs final shouts of pleasure. His whole body is thrumming with the force of it, blood rushing in his ears, waves of pleasure seeming to last forever.</p><p>Dazed, Felix floats mindlessly for a few minutes. The aftershocks of his orgasm wash over him in pleasant shivers.¬†</p><p>His stomach and chest are covered in cum, which Felix usually finds disgusting, but his mind‚Äôs stuck on loop imagining that it‚Äôs Sylvain‚Äôs. He shudders, feeling warm as he pictures Sylvain cleaning him up, kissing him with his own taste still on his tongue.</p><p>When he finally comes back to reality, the audio is still going, Sylvain trying to catch his breath too.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶oh, wow,‚Äù Sylvain pants, sounding almost reverent. ‚ÄúHoly shit, that was‚Ä¶even better than I thought it would be.‚Äù¬†</p><p>Another minute or so passes before both of their breathing starts to even out.¬†</p><p>‚ÄúI may have gone off script a little at the end, heh‚Ä¶let my imagination run wild there for a minute‚Ä¶‚Äù Sylvain sounds relaxed and sleepy now, letting his words trail off, voice deep and low. The soft cadence would make Felix drowsy even if he wasn‚Äôt fucked out and completely sated.¬†</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶But, I came so hard I practically blacked out‚Ä¶so it all works out in the end.‚Äù A loud yawn, then he mumbles, ‚ÄúThink I needed that‚Ä¶and I also need to sleep now, so‚Ä¶until next time.‚Äù</p><p>The audio cuts off. Felix lies there in silence for a minute before reluctantly heading to the bathroom to clean up. He really is wrung out and exhausted ‚Äì it‚Äôs hard to stop yawning while he‚Äôs brushing his teeth.¬†</p><p>There will surely be‚Ä¶emotions‚Ä¶for him to process tomorrow, but for now, Felix‚Äôs mind is blissfully blank, and he can only drag himself back to bed, falling asleep the instant his head hits the pillow.¬†</p><p>¬†</p>

  <p>Sunday morning comes, and Felix wakes up to his alarm from a blissful, dreamless sleep.</p><p>He takes a few minutes to bask in the unusual relaxation, which ends up being a mistake ‚Äì letting his brain wake up with nothing else to distract it means that the hazy memory of last night comes crashing over him like a bucket of cold water ‚Äì and he bolts upright in bed.</p><p>Did he really‚Äì ? If it were a dream, at least Felix could blame his unconscious mind, but‚Äì</p><p>Ugh. He really did. It‚Äôs obvious once he unlocks his phone and his browser is still on the page for Sylvain‚Äôs audio file.</p><p>Felix flops back on the pillow with a loud groan. Maybe he should just stay in bed today. Ingrid‚Äôs only gone for a week, anyway ‚Äì they could always catch up later.</p><p>Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no possibility of going back to sleep. The flush of embarrassment is more potent than even the strongest coffee, and he‚Äôs fully awake now, nearly vibrating with nervous energy.</p><p>At least the weather seems nice today, and the sun‚Äôs only just up, so it‚Äôs the perfect time for a run to clear his thoughts.</p><p>Felix throws on some fresh clothes, quickly refills the cats‚Äô food and water downstairs, and bolts out the door. Sylvain doesn‚Äôt seem to be awake yet ‚Äì it‚Äôs very early and his door is still closed ‚Äì but it would be just Felix‚Äôs luck for him to pop up out of nowhere and startle him into doing something stupid. Like blurting out a guilty confession of his illicit activities last night.</p><p>Once outside, he sets a brisk pace, heading for the riverside trail near their apartment. The rushing of the water is loud this morning, the river full and lively from the rainstorm yesterday; it‚Äôs the perfect backdrop for Felix‚Äôs tumultuous thoughts.</p><p>The whole point of Felix getting off to Sylvain‚Äôs voice last night was to calm him down, get it out of his system so he could at least pretend to act normal around Sylvain ‚Äì but Felix can already tell that it was only a partial success.</p><p>He does feel less pent up now, less sensitive to any touch ‚Äì at the very least, he probably won‚Äôt get hard just from being around Sylvain and his general cuddliness. And he supposes it did help with his overall stress levels. Despite his current anxieties, Felix can‚Äôt actually recall a time he‚Äôs ever woken up more relaxed.</p><p>But annoyingly, his fixation on Sylvain‚Äôs voice seems to have only gotten worse. Every moan, gasp, and broken sentence has been seared into his brain, and it takes a ridiculous amount of effort to steer his mind away from playing them all on loop ‚Äì a never-ending reminder of his weakness.</p><p>Honestly, he‚Äôs never had this kind of problem with anyone else. Hearing his previous partners‚Äô noises in bed was exciting at first, but after a while he just got used to it, the physical sensations becoming more important.</p><p>Maybe he needs to do the same thing with Sylvain‚Äôs voice, just desensitize himself to it?</p><p>Felix <em>has</em> managed to get used to shirtless Sylvain, sweaty Sylvain, Sylvain wet and dripping straight out of the shower‚Ä¶at least, enough that he only blushes under extenuating circumstances.</p><p>This can‚Äôt be too much different.</p><p>He really must be well-rested this morning, because it feels like it‚Äôs only taken a couple minutes to reach his favorite stopping point on the trail ‚Äì a huge, wooden bridge arcing over the river that‚Äôs usually twenty minutes‚Äô distance from home. It‚Äôs intricately detailed, and wide enough to accommodate both the pathway and comfortable benches on either side for passers-by to sit and watch the rushing water or the clouds above.</p><p>Panting, Felix eases into a walk to cool down, pacing the length of the bridge a few times before taking over one of the benches.</p><p>If he‚Äôs going to try to desensitize himself to Sylvain‚Äôs voice, he might as well take a look at what he has to work with.</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs post is still open on his phone, thankfully ‚Äì there‚Äôs no way Felix would have remembered his ridiculous username. @galoot_of_ill_repute‚Ä¶how very like Sylvain to poke fun at himself, both for his reputation and his peculiar knowledge of uncommon vocabulary.</p><p>Clicking through to Sylvain‚Äôs profile page, Felix sees there are four audio posts in total. That seems like it should be enough to dampen his interest.</p><p>In his past relationships, the sounds of sex lost their novelty by the end of the first or second encounter, and that was when his attraction was reciprocated‚Ä¶it should be even easier to tire himself out on someone he‚Äôs not allowed to have.</p><p>The oldest post is the mandatory introduction, from almost 5 months earlier. Another two were uploaded 2 and 3 months after the intro, and the audio he listened to last night is the most recent, posted‚Ä¶only a week and a half ago.</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>Just ten days ago, Sylvain was ‚Äì</p><p>Felix hurries to cut off that line of thought before it can escalate. He needs to hold on to at least some of the relaxation from his restful sleep as long as possible if he has any hope of getting through lunch with his sanity intact.</p><p>Ears burning, he quickly bookmarks the page for later and closes the tab.</p><p>He‚Äôs feeling a little too warm now, although it‚Äôs not just from his embarrassed arousal ‚Äì the morning sun is now well into the sky, bright and hot enough that sitting outside of the shade is starting to feel uncomfortable.</p><p>The river looks cool and tempting, so he stows his phone and makes his way across the bridge and down to the waterline. Under the shadow of the riverside trees, there‚Äôs an outcropping of smooth, flat rocks to sit on, and Felix takes off his shoes and lets his feet dip into the river.</p><p>Concentrating only on the rush of the river and how the current tickles against his skin, it‚Äôs easy to calm down, his heart rate slowing back to normal.</p><p>It feels a little nostalgic, sticking his feet in the water like this. Back when Felix, Sylvain, Dimitri, and Ingrid were young and still an inseparable group, they spent countless summers skipping stones across the river near Dimitri‚Äôs childhood home, letting their toes grow wrinkly from soaking for hours, playing through elaborate scenarios of knights and princes, staying out too late and getting eaten by mosquitoes‚Ä¶things were simpler then.</p><p>Though, he supposes, their group really isn‚Äôt so different now. They‚Äôd all had their own falling-outs and disappearing acts over the years, but they‚Äôd made their way back to each other eventually, as if their friendship was a force as strong and ever-present as gravity.</p><p>Even now, there‚Äôs no one Felix trusts more than his three oldest friends.</p><p>It‚Äôll be nice to see them today, despite his brief misgivings earlier. Their schedules don‚Äôt all line up like this very often ‚Äì Felix himself was swamped with work the last few times he got an invite ‚Äì so he won‚Äôt let anything less than a force of nature prevent him from showing up this time.</p><p>As long as he avoids touching Sylvain, and Sylvain avoids moaning over how good the food is, everything should be just fine.</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>Everything is <em>not</em> just fine.</p><p>Dimitri has brought Claude to lunch, which is all well and good, except that Claude insists on sitting next to him, and Ingrid and Dorothea always sit across from one another so they can play footsie.</p><p>‚Ä¶All of which leaves Felix stuck between Sylvain and the wall on one side of the cramped booth.</p><p>He‚Äôs trying his best to avoid touching Sylvain, but Dorothea is on Sylvain‚Äôs other side, gushing about her upcoming trip with Ingrid ‚Äì and from the way Sylvain is shifting towards him, her excited gestures are taking up more room by the minute.</p><p>Sylvain seems antsy today, too ‚Äì he‚Äôs bouncing his leg and shifting in his seat so there‚Äôs always some part of him constantly brushing against Felix‚Äôs leg or arm or side. It‚Äôs incredibly distracting.</p><p>By the time the server arrives to take their order, Sylvain‚Äôs left side is fully pressed against Felix‚Äôs right, shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh, and Felix can‚Äôt scoot any further over without phasing into the wall ‚Äì which would actually be preferable to the current situation, now that he thinks about it. Who needs a corporeal form, anyway.</p><p>To make things worse, Felix is seated directly across from Claude, who keeps glancing between him and Sylvain with a knowing look in his eye, grinning widely whenever Felix catches him in the act. Felix barely restrains the urge to kick him under the table when he suddenly winks, blatantly advertising that he‚Äôs figured out Felix‚Äôs secret.</p><p>This entire situation is Claude‚Äôs fault, actually. Why does Dimitri have to have a crush on someone so infuriating?</p><p>‚Äú‚ÄìFelix? Is everything alright? You haven‚Äôt said a word since we got here.‚Äù</p><p>Dimitri‚Äôs concerned tone breaks through Felix‚Äôs bubble of irritation, though he still sounds snappier than he‚Äôd like when he replies.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just hungry. And a little too <em>warm.</em>‚Äù He punctuates the word with a gentle elbow to Sylvain‚Äôs ribs.</p><p>Sylvain only looks over at him, grinning brightly and leaning further into Felix‚Äôs side, before turning his attention back to Dorothea.</p><p>‚ÄúUgh. I‚Äôm not a pillow, Sylvain,‚Äù he grumbles.</p><p>But Sylvain‚Äôs smile has sapped most of the bite from Felix‚Äôs voice, and Claude gives him another cheeky grin across the table.</p><p>Whatever.</p><p>‚ÄúHe is a space heater, isn‚Äôt he,‚Äù Dimitri says. ‚ÄúWhy not just remove your jacket?‚Äù</p><p>
  <em>Because skin-to-skin contact would only make it worse.</em>
</p><p>But of course Felix can‚Äôt say that out loud, so he just shrugs.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, then is there some <em>other</em> reason you‚Äôre feeling overheated?‚Äù Claude says, evilly.</p><p>Felix wants to counter with a taunt of his own, but Claude looks completely unbothered to be pressed up against Dimitri, not flustered in the least. And unfortunately, pointing out Dimitri‚Äôs blush wouldn‚Äôt affect Claude at all ‚Äì it‚Äôd only make his friend feel awkward.</p><p>Whatever. Felix won‚Äôt meddle, because Dimitri doesn‚Äôt want him to. Even if it means putting up with Claude poking at the sleeping beast that is Felix‚Äôs attraction to Sylvain.</p><p>Sighing, Felix pushes Sylvain just upright enough that he can stand and peel off his jacket, leaving only his sleeveless turtleneck underneath. It‚Äôs a little chilly for a second, no longer being surrounded by body heat ‚Äì but then Sylvain places a palm on Felix‚Äôs knee, and he drops back into his seat, scalded.</p><p>‚Äú<em>What</em> are you <em>doing,</em>‚Äù he hisses into Sylvain‚Äôs ear, taking his hand and placing it firmly back onto his leg where it belongs.</p><p>‚ÄúI thought you were trying to leave,‚Äù Sylvain says, a small pout on his lips.</p><p>‚ÄúLeave‚Äì? How? By climbing over the back of the booth?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you‚Äôve haven‚Äôt done that before, Fe,‚Äù Sylvain says, eyebrow raised, squeezing Felix‚Äôs hand to emphasize his point.</p><p>‚Ä¶Wait. Why is his hand still holding Sylvain‚Äôs?</p><p>He pulls it back as soon as Sylvain lets go, feeling a blush bloom over his face ‚Äì apparently his body is just determined to betray him today.</p><p>‚ÄúWhatever. That was ages ago. I wouldn‚Äôt run out on you now,‚Äù Felix says. At least his voice comes out steady.</p><p>‚ÄúGood!‚Äù Ingrid butts in cheerily ‚Äì of course she‚Äôs been eavesdropping. ‚ÄúBecause I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to chase you down if you tried.‚Äù</p><p>Dimitri nods. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get together very often as it is. It wouldn‚Äôt be right for anyone to dine and dash, or I suppose, dash without dining in this case.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúThat means ‚Äòleave without paying‚Äô, not ‚Äòabandon your friends and break their hearts‚Äô, Mitya,‚Äù Claude teases, and Dimitri‚Äôs blush grows brighter, even though Felix is the butt of the joke.</p><p>Sylvain laughs, though it comes out slightly strained. ‚ÄúAww, Felix would never break our hearts. If I remember right, he booked it last time because I wouldn‚Äôt shut up about girls. Totally fair.‚Äù</p><p>Felix does remember. He also remembers that the reason he left so abruptly wasn‚Äôt because he was sick of hearing about girls ‚Äì although he <em>was</em> sick of it ‚Äì it was because he couldn‚Äôt stand how fake Sylvain‚Äôs smile was as he talked. The self-loathing was rolling off him in waves; Felix couldn‚Äôt understand how the others didn‚Äôt see it. Or maybe they did see it, but like Felix, they had no idea how to help.</p><p>He can see some of that self-loathing coming back into Sylvain‚Äôs eyes now, and he‚Äôd do anything to banish it again.</p><p>‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Felix says, firmly, and deliberately leans into Sylvain‚Äôs side a little. ‚ÄúI should have stayed.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain presses closer too, a mirror of Felix‚Äôs movement. ‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù</p><p>Felix nods.</p><p>‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù</p><p>That‚Äôs all it takes for Sylvain‚Äôs real smile to return, and Felix relaxes, relieved.</p><p>The conversation turns back to the latest developments in everyone‚Äôs lives. It‚Äôs easier for Felix to focus now for some reason, even though he‚Äôs still fully pressed up against Sylvain, heart still racing from the proximity.</p><p>Maybe it‚Äôs because it feels like the contact is necessary now ‚Äì an anchor to remind Sylvain that Felix wants to be here.</p><p>Their food arrives, and the table is quieter for a bit as everyone digs in. Someone must have ordered for Felix while he was stuck in his own head earlier, but it‚Äôs one of his favorites, so he can‚Äôt complain.</p><p>Ingrid finishes her meal first, as usual, and excitedly resumes Dorothea‚Äôs earlier description of their coming vacation. She‚Äôs just finished listing all the restaurants she wants to visit while they‚Äôre in Enbarr when Felix‚Äôs phone chimes loudly with a text.</p><p>Felix has to lean away from Sylvain to retrieve his phone from his pocket, which is annoying, but when he sees the contents of the text he‚Äôs glad he checked the message so promptly.</p><p>‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm going out of town tomorrow as well,‚Äù he says to the group, after shooting off a quick response.</p><p>‚ÄúAh, for work or for <em>pleasure</em>?‚Äù Dorothea asks with a saucy wink.</p><p>Ingrid rolls her eyes affectionately, but for some reason Sylvain stiffens up beside him.</p><p>‚ÄúWork, obviously,‚Äù Felix replies. ‚ÄúThe boss is sick and can‚Äôt make the trip out to work on the case for the client in Hrym. Unfortunately I‚Äôm the only one who can spare a week.‚Äù</p><p>At that, Sylvain relaxes again, flopping his entire body weight against Felix‚Äôs side and using his shoulder like a pillow. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll be gone for the whole <em>week</em>? That‚Äôs no fuuuun,‚Äù he whines petulantly.</p><p>Felix snorts. ‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt be dramatic. At least you‚Äôll have the cats to keep you company.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúWait, they‚Äôre sending just you, not Lysithea too?‚Äù Claude asks, eyes wide in disbelief. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gonna be a ton of work to handle on your own.‚Äù</p><p>Felix nods. ‚ÄúShe requested the week off a long time ago, so I can‚Äôt blame her. But I can manage by myself,‚Äù he says with a shrug, inadvertently dislodging Sylvain‚Äôs cheek from his shoulder.</p><p>Honestly, he‚Äôs dreading the prospect of both the last minute travel and the massive amount of work, especially coming out of such a pleasant weekend, but it‚Äôs nowhere near the most annoying thing he‚Äôs had to do for work. And Felix usually works faster on his own, anyway.</p><p>Sylvain shoves his face back into the fabric of Felix‚Äôs turtleneck with another dramatic whine, and ‚Äì was that ‚Äì ? Sylvain‚Äôs lips? That just brushed against his bare shoulder?</p><p>
  <em>Fuck.</em>
</p><p>The room is suddenly suffocatingly warm, and Felix has to pinch his own leg ‚Äì hard ‚Äì to force his focus back to the conversation.</p><p>‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, this kind of thing would never happen if you just left that place and joined my firm like I‚Äôve been asking you to,‚Äù Claude is saying, the quirk of his eyebrows both smug and amused.</p><p>He‚Äôs probably right, but Felix would rather deal with any number of unplanned trips than put up with Claude‚Äôs now-inevitable teasing every day of the week.</p><p>Once he and Dimitri finally get together, maybe Claude will be occupied enough with his own love life to stop pestering Felix about his, and he‚Äôll be able to seriously consider the offer. But until then, Felix is staying right where he is.</p><p>‚ÄúYou mean, like you‚Äôve been <em>making Dimitri</em> ask me,‚Äù he says, one eyebrow raised. ‚ÄúIt is possible for you to text me yourself, you know.‚Äù</p><p>Dimitri startles at his name, apparently having zoned out while staring at Claude.</p><p>‚ÄúOh! It‚Äôs quite alright, Felix,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI enjoy it, actually. Staying up to date on Cla‚Äì I mean, both of your work lives is very interesting, even if I do not entirely understand what is going on.‚Äù</p><p>Dimitri‚Äôs blushing brightly again at his slip-up, but Claude doesn‚Äôt seem to have noticed, as he‚Äôs smirking at Felix even wider now.</p><p>‚ÄúSee? Even Mitya thinks you should join me! Your friends are very wise,‚Äù Claude says triumphantly. Then, with a soft look at Dimitri, he adds, ‚ÄúAt least this one is, anyway.‚Äù</p><p>Felix suppresses a groan. They are both so goddess-damned <em>obvious</em>.</p><p>Ingrid and Dorothea seem to agree with his frustration ‚Äì they‚Äôre leaning over the table towards each other to whisper and giggle among themselves, shooting exasperated looks back at all four of the men.</p><p>‚ÄúWell, it‚Äôs not like I could leave the firm right now even if I wanted to,‚Äù Felix says, ‚Äúbut I‚Äôll keep your offer in mind in case something changes.‚Äù</p><p>An irritated ‚Äú<em>just like I‚Äôve said I would every single time you ask</em>‚Äù is on the tip of his tongue, but then the server arrives with the check, and Sylvain nearly leaps from his seat to begin the traditional squabble over who pays, leaving Felix bereft of his warmth.</p><p>This time, they decide the winner will be determined by a breath-holding contest. Claude eagerly joins in with the usual quartet of Dimitri, Ingrid, Sylvain, and Felix.</p><p>It comes down to Felix and Dimitri, and Dimitri holds out just a second longer, to Felix‚Äôs disappointment. He mentally adds another 15 minutes to his daily cardio routine as Dimitri pulls out his wallet, beaming.</p><p>‚ÄúI don‚Äôt often win these, unless we choose something strength-based like arm wrestling,‚Äù Dimitri explains to Claude, almost shyly.</p><p>‚ÄúAnd of course we all know no one has a chance against him then,‚Äù Ingrid adds, ‚Äúso we usually pick something else unless he‚Äôs looking particularly put-upon.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOh, the puppy eyes <em>are</em> unfairly powerful!‚Äù Claude agrees with a chuckle.</p><p>As they head outside, Dimitri invites everyone to his house to continue socializing ‚Äì but Ingrid, Dorothea, and Felix still have packing to do, and Sylvain is Felix‚Äôs ride, so only Claude accepts in the end.</p><p>Felix would apologize, but Dimitri clearly isn‚Äôt too upset about this outcome. His eye is bright and excited as Claude lays a hand on his arm, standing on tiptoes to whisper something into his ear that makes him blush bright red yet again.</p><p>For a moment, Felix catches Sylvain staring at them wistfully, and the pounding of his heart that‚Äôs been a constant all day suddenly feels painful in his chest.</p><p>Of course ‚Äì of <em>course</em> Sylvain is feeling a little nostalgic. He should have known.</p><p>Not for the first time, Felix wonders if Sylvain regrets moving in with him. Wonders if he‚Äôs depriving himself of intimacy for Felix‚Äôs sake alone, and not because he‚Äôs happier to be single for once.</p><p>Admittedly, Sylvain does seem to be doing better since he stopped having meaningless flings‚Ä¶but not all relationships have to be meaningless. What if he‚Äôs ready to take dating seriously, and staying celibate in Felix‚Äôs apartment is preventing him from meeting the love of his life? As much as Felix‚Äôs heart would break to see Sylvain truly in love with someone else, he‚Äôs not sure whether he could forgive himself if Sylvain missed a chance for real happiness because of him.</p><p>Or‚Ä¶maybe that wistful look is because he‚Äôs already in love? With Dimitri, or, somehow, with Claude?</p><p>Ugh. This is too much to think about in public.</p><p>Felix pointedly shoves all his guilt and worry and longing into a box in the back of his mind, and shuts it away tightly to mull over later.</p><p>After a truly excruciating group hug in the parking lot ‚Äì Dimitri and Sylvain using their height advantage to crush everyone else inside the loop of their arms ‚Äì they all start to gradually drift their separate ways.</p><p>Needing a moment to himself, Felix heads over to pace next to Sylvain‚Äôs car, waiting for him to finish up his conversation with Ingrid and Dorothea.</p><p>As usual, lunch has extended almost into early dinner. Felix‚Äôs flight is at 4am tomorrow morning, and the afternoon has passed so quickly that he‚Äôs starting to feel a little stressed about the time crunch of stopping by his office, packing, and getting at least a little sleep before he has to leave. With how disorganized his boss is, it could take hours just to track down all the files he needs.</p><p>Felix is so engrossed in going over everything he needs to do before he leaves that he almost startles out of his skin at the sudden hand on his shoulder. But before he can react, Sylvain is spinning him around and pulling him into a hug even more crushing than being sandwiched between Claude, Ingrid, and Dorothea a few minutes ago.</p><p>Unlike the group hug, though, this is‚Ä¶extremely nice.</p><p>It‚Äôs not often that Felix lets himself indulge in touching Sylvain like this. But it seems like Sylvain needs the contact today, so he allows himself to lean into the hug, sliding his hands around Sylvain‚Äôs waist to rest on his back.</p><p>Sylvain smells so good, and his arms are so warm, and his collarbone is <em>right</em> there‚Ä¶</p><p>
  <em>Want you to press on the bruises later and remember you‚Äôre all <strong>mine</strong>.</em>
</p><p>Fuck. This is the absolute <em>worst</em> time to remember how Sylvain‚Äôs voice had gotten so heated, so deliciously possessive, such a perfect mirror of Felix‚Äôs own intensifying desire to mark Sylvain as <em>his</em>.</p><p>He‚Äôs feeling a little too tempted to press his lips against Sylvain‚Äôs neck and taste every inch of that freckled skin; too compelled to push aside the fabric of Sylvain‚Äôs collar and devote himself to finding all the sweet, sensitive spots that will make him moan in pleasure.</p><p>Trying to hide both his heated blush and his view of Sylvain‚Äôs skin, Felix shoves his face fully into the front of Sylvain‚Äôs shirt. It just barely prevents the thread of his self-control from snapping.</p><p>Unfortunately, this position is only a little less frustrating. With his ear now pressed to Sylvain‚Äôs chest, Felix can hear Sylvain‚Äôs heart pounding just as fast as his own, and he can‚Äôt help but wish that <em>he </em>might be the cause ‚Äì that pressing against Felix like this could be possibly affecting Sylvain enough to make his pulse race.</p><p>But logically, it‚Äôs much more likely that the rushed rhythm of Sylvain‚Äôs heartbeat is the result of whatever emotions were behind that wistful stare towards Dimitri and Claude ‚Äì not anything related to Felix.</p><p>Felix is still avoiding that train of thought, though, so he focuses all his mental energy on controlling his breathing, trying to keep it from hitching every time Sylvain pulls him a little closer.</p><p>They stand that way for a few minutes, swaying together in the now nearly-empty parking lot. Sylvain‚Äôs grip gradually loosens as he relaxes, and he occasionally hums a little into Felix‚Äôs hair.</p><p>‚ÄúThanks, Fe,‚Äù Sylvain eventually says, voice hoarse with something Felix can‚Äôt identify.</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶For what?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúFor coming to this, and staying, I guess. Last time we did lunch without you, it‚Ä¶did not go well,‚Äù he mumbles against Felix‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúIngrid and I had a massive fight, and she wouldn‚Äôt respond to my texts for a whole month‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt remember if I told you about that ‚Äì it was before I moved in with you. Today was the first time I‚Äôve seen her since.‚Äù</p><p>Is that why Sylvain‚Äôs been so restless today?</p><p>‚ÄúMm,‚Äù Felix says, partially to encourage Sylvain to continue, and partially because he‚Äôs currently incapable of saying anything more intelligent, too distracted by the little thrills of warmth still vibrating through him from each point of contact between them.</p><p>‚ÄúAnyway, it doesn‚Äôt really matter, I guess, because she would have brought it up again if she was still upset. And she didn‚Äôt, so it‚Äôs all good.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain sighs, and squeezes him tighter for a moment before he continues.</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶Also, thanks for letting me channel Spook and rub all over you, haha. It actually really helped. With me being nervous, I mean.‚Äù</p><p>
  <em>Rub all over him?</em>
</p><p>There‚Äôs no stopping how Felix‚Äôs body responds to those words ‚Äì sending another shock of warmth to his face, and a spark of interest to his cock that leaves him instantly half-hard.</p><p>Suddenly, he can‚Äôt get last night‚Äôs promise of a massage out of his mind.</p><p>Seiros, why did Sylvain have to phrase it like that?</p><p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶good,‚Äù Felix manages to grit out before pulling away. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad it helped.‚Äù He <em>is</em> glad, and he hopes it shows in his voice, but continuing to touch Sylvain right now is a recipe for disaster.</p><p>Thankfully, Sylvain seems to interpret his disengagement from the hug as eagerness to get home and nothing more. ‚ÄúOh! I forgot you have to be up crazy early. We should head back, huh,‚Äù he says, pulling out his keys and unlocking the car.</p><p>The drive back to their apartment is mostly quiet, Sylvain occasionally humming along to songs on the radio, until Felix gets another text from his boss.</p><p>‚ÄúFuuuuuck,‚Äù he groans, irritated. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs apparently two entire <em>boxes</em> of paper files for this case‚Ä¶I‚Äôm going to need a whole suitcase just for that. Ugh.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain glances over at him, then back to the road. ‚ÄúThat sucks. I always forget how out of date the legal field is ‚Äì you‚Äôd think everyone would want electronic files by now, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù he says.</p><p>‚ÄúNot my boss, unfortunately,‚Äù Felix replies. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs definitely‚Ä¶old-fashioned.‚Äù</p><p>Although, hopefully ‚Äúboxes‚Äù means that the files are at least already all in one place so he won‚Äôt have to spend the whole evening scouring the office for them.</p><p>After a moment, Sylvain makes a thoughtful noise. ‚ÄúWhat about tonight? If you want, I can drive you there so it‚Äôs easier to get them back home?‚Äù</p><p>Felix doesn‚Äôt want to take up Sylvain‚Äôs entire evening, but ‚Äì he did offer, and the thought of lugging boxes of documents onto the train is decidedly unpleasant.</p><p>‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶yes. If you don‚Äôt mind, that would help.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúOf course I don‚Äôt mind, Felix. Although, you should be prepared‚Ä¶I may demand ‚Äòcompensation‚Äô later.‚Äù</p><p>Keeping one hand on the wheel, Sylvain uses the other to indicate the air-quotes, grinning mischievously.</p><p>Felix scoffs. ‚ÄúFine. But If you ask for something ridiculous, I won‚Äôt hesitate to punch you.‚Äù It‚Äôs an idle threat ‚Äì the worst he‚Äôd really do is refuse ‚Äì but Sylvain already knows that.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, don‚Äôt worry. I‚Äôll make sure to request something we‚Äôll <em>both</em> enjoy.‚Äù Sylvain winks, the drawl of his voice almost‚Ä¶flirtatious?</p><p>No, that‚Äôs ridiculous. Listening to that audio was clearly the worst decision of Felix‚Äôs life ‚Äì he‚Äôs now sunk to the level of projecting desire into Sylvain‚Äôs voice, when there‚Äôs obviously nothing there but his usual charm and friendly affection.</p><p>‚ÄúTch. Or you could just keep it simple and I‚Äôll owe you a favor for next time.‚Äù</p><p>But seeing Sylvain still smiling as they pull into the parking lot of Felix‚Äôs office, still humming cheerily as he helps load the boxes into the car‚Ä¶</p><p>‚Ä¶Felix knows there‚Äôs almost nothing Sylvain could request that he wouldn‚Äôt do.</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>The flight from Fhirdiad to Gronder Airport is relatively short, but Felix still sleeps the entire time ‚Äì he‚Äôd ended up getting only three hours of sleep at home, even with Sylvain‚Äôs help. He also nods off in the taxi from the airport to the city of Hrym, and wakes up only when the driver knocks on his window from outside, waiting next to the car with his luggage.</p><p>Thankfully, his naps were restful and dreamless, and Felix finally feels awake enough to start making headway on the work for this week.</p><p>It‚Äôs almost 8am, so it‚Äôs too early to check into the hotel, but he doesn‚Äôt meet with the client until noon, so he decides to take advantage of the sprawling hotel lobby and its free coffee to start going through all the files for the case.</p><p>But first, he should probably text Sylvain, to let him know he arrived safely, and his brother, so he won‚Äôt get scolded later for not telling him he‚Äôs within visiting distance of Goneril.</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:54am): I‚Äôm at the hotel. If you‚Äôre reading this before noon go back to bed, there‚Äôs no need for us both to be exhausted.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:59am): Hey Glenn. I‚Äôm in Hrym for work until Friday night. Now you can‚Äôt be mad I didn‚Äôt tell you. I won‚Äôt have time to visit but we can get lunch if you come down.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>There‚Äôs no immediate response from either of them, and Felix breathes a sigh of relief knowing Sylvain is hopefully still asleep.</p><p>It‚Äôs not a good idea to let himself think too much about Sylvain, though ‚Äì the phantom heat on his skin from yesterday‚Äôs copious physical contact and the ever-present echoes of Sylvain‚Äôs noises of pleasure are a sure path to distraction.</p><p>To snap himself into work mode, Felix goes for another cup of shitty coffee, plugs in his earbuds to listen to his ‚Äúfocus‚Äù playlist, and starts digging into the documents.</p><p>The day passes quickly and surprisingly pleasantly once he gets into the zone. He manages to comb through a decent amount of the files before meeting with the client, and the client herself turns out to be easy to work with and calmer than most.</p><p>So it‚Äôs not until the evening ‚Äì when Felix finally makes it back to his hotel room after dinner ‚Äì that it finally hits him.</p><p>This will be the first night he‚Äôs spent away from home since Sylvain moved in.</p><p>The realization makes something unpleasant curl through his stomach and up into his throat. After a moment, Felix is able to identify the emotion, and the sheer ridiculousness of it has him groaning loudly and flopping face first onto the bed.</p><p>Really? He misses Sylvain <em>already</em>?</p><p>Seiros, he is such a hypocrite for calling Sylvain dramatic yesterday if this is how it‚Äôs going to be. It hasn‚Äôt even been 24 hours since they‚Äôve seen each other. Why can‚Äôt he just be grateful that he has someone trustworthy looking after the cats and leave it at that?</p><p>Groaning again, Felix droops off the bed and onto the floor ‚Äì if he goes limp enough, maybe Sothis will be merciful and turn his body into a gelatinous blob. Gelatinous blobs don‚Äôt have feelings, or fall in unrequited love with their best friend, or get turned on every fucking time they think about that friend and his incredibly sexy voice.</p><p>But alas, the goddess does not hear his plea.</p><p>The floor is too cold and hard for it to be comfortable for long, so Felix reluctantly gets back onto the bed, grabbing his phone from the charger. Since he‚Äôs had it on silent all day, there are a few texts waiting for his response.</p><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:59am): Hey Glenn. I‚Äôm in Hrym for work until Friday night. Now you can‚Äôt be mad I didn‚Äôt tell you. I won‚Äôt have time to visit but we can get lunch if you come down.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Glenn (10:13am): Incorrect! I can be mad about whatever I want. How does Thursday lunch sound? Holst wants to come too.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (8:24pm): Holst is fine, but no Hilda. I‚Äôm really not in the mood for his blatant matchmaking, and you know she hates it just as much. Thursday works.</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><blockquote>
  <p>Annette (11:30am): Feliiiiiix!!!! You didn‚Äôt tell me you were leaving town this week!!!!!! Now who is supposed to taste-test my new muffin recipe and make sure it‚Äôs not too sweet? üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠</p>

  <p>Felix (8:27pm): It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm gone forever, you know. I‚Äôll try it next week.</p>

  <p>Sylvain (4:49pm): [video attached]</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>Felix opens the video, and it begins with Sylvain‚Äôs face as he holds a finger up to his lips in a shushing motion. His hair is an absolute mess ‚Äì Felix has to clench his fist against the strong urge to run his fingers through those soft red waves.</p><p>Then the camera flips around as Sylvain moves towards Felix‚Äôs bedroom ‚Äì the door is half closed, and his hand comes into view, slowly pushing it all the way open. He seems to be quietly tiptoeing towards the bed, and the reason soon becomes apparent: Spook and Lumi are curled up together in a perfect circle, sleeping right in the center of Felix‚Äôs pillow. They almost look like yin and yang, with Lumi‚Äôs white fur against the black of Spook‚Äôs, except that Lumi rudely has a leg splayed out across Spook‚Äôs neck. Felix snorts ‚Äì typical Lumi.</p><p>The camera flips back to Sylvain. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve been like this since I woke up! Maybe even longer,‚Äù he whispers. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt blame them, your pillows do look super comfy.‚Äù Sylvain winks, teasing, then waves at the camera and the video ends.</p><p>Felix saves the video, then pauses, cursor blinking at the bottom of his text conversation with Sylvain. The video was cute, but he doesn‚Äôt really know how to respond to the texts.</p><p>‚ÄúGood. As you should,‚Äù is what he wants to write, or ‚ÄúI miss them too,‚Äù but those are both painfully sappy. Also, the second one ignores his main problem, which is that he misses <em>Sylvain</em> right now, much more than the cats.</p><p>His finger hovers over the call button in the corner. Should he just‚Äì?</p><p>Felix hardly ever calls Sylvain first, but then again, he‚Äôs hardly ever out of town.</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>He hits the button before he can talk himself out of it, pressing the phone to his ear.</p><p>It rings once, twice, three times, and Felix is just about to give up and end the call before it goes to voicemail when Sylvain finally picks up.</p><p>‚ÄúHah ‚Äì Felix?‚Äù Sylvain gasps. ‚ÄúAre you ‚Äì hah ‚Äì okay? Did something happen?‚Äù</p><p>He‚Äôs panting hard into Felix‚Äôs ear like he‚Äôs been training for a marathon. Felix‚Äôs brain unhelpfully conjures memories of Sylvain out of breath for a much more pleasurable reason, and it takes all of his concentration to try to answer Sylvain as if he‚Äôs completely unaffected.</p><p>‚ÄúNo, nothing happened. I‚Äôm fine,‚Äù Felix says, but he can‚Äôt tell if it sounds weird over the noise of his pulse pounding in his ears. ‚ÄúIs it ‚Äì were you just on the treadmill or something?‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain laughs, high and breathless. ‚Äú‚Ä¶Something like that.‚Äù</p><p>What is that supposed to mean? Felix doesn‚Äôt dare ask for details ‚Äì if there‚Äôs even a hint that he was right to imagine Sylvain recording another audio, he might just spontaneously combust.</p><p>‚ÄúSo, if it‚Äôs not an emergency, what‚Äôs up then? I can‚Äôt even remember the last time you called me without texting first,‚Äù Sylvain continues, sounding a little less winded now.</p><p>Fuck. Felix didn‚Äôt think this far ahead. He can‚Äôt very well say he just called to hear Sylvain‚Äôs voice.</p><p>‚ÄúNothing‚Äôs up,‚Äù he says, stalling. ‚ÄúI just, uh‚Ä¶‚Äù Suddenly, Felix remembers he hadn‚Äôt actually verbally thanked Sylvain for his help last night and this morning. ‚ÄúWanted to thank you for driving me to the airport. And the office. You didn‚Äôt have to lose sleep over me.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúJust to thank me, huh?‚Äù Sylvain sounds amused. ‚ÄúShould I take this as a sign you‚Äôre being held hostage or something? Or is this even the real Felix?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúTch. If you‚Äôre going to be like that I‚Äôll just hang up‚Äì‚Äù</p><p>‚Äú‚ÄìNo!‚Äù Sylvain hurriedly interrupts. ‚ÄúSorry, sorry, I‚Äôll stop! ‚Ä¶And I didn‚Äôt mean that I think you‚Äôre ungrateful, by the way. I was just surprised you‚Äôd call over something like that.‚Äù</p><p>He sounds pleased, though, so Felix makes a mental note to call him more often, or at least often enough that he doesn‚Äôt immediately assume it‚Äôs an emergency.</p><p>‚ÄúDid you call out of work today?‚Äù Felix asks, changing the subject.</p><p>‚ÄúNah, they don‚Äôt really care when I do the work, as long as it gets done and I don‚Äôt miss any meetings. And today is No-Meetings-Monday, so it all worked out,‚Äù Sylvain says. ‚ÄúOh, shit‚Äì!‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs suddenly a loud crash, pans hitting the floor if Felix had to guess, and he has to pull the phone away from his ear for a second. ‚ÄúSylvain?‚Äù he asks once the noise has died down.</p><p>More clattering, then Sylvain picks up the phone again. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, it‚Äôs fine! I just dropped some dishes. That‚Äôs what I get for trying to make dinner one-handed. Can I put you on speakerphone?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSure. What are you making?‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain hums, distracted for a minute. The sound of it amongst the other kitchen noises makes Felix smile, his chest tight with affection ‚Äì this is turning out to be a pretty good substitute for actually being at home.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, I forgot to tell you!‚Äù Sylvain suddenly exclaims. ‚ÄúDedue‚Äôs going to teach me how to make some dishes from Duscur, so I bought all these spices I‚Äôve never used before‚Ä¶hmmm, chop the vegetables? What size pieces though‚Ä¶‚Äù He trails off again, muttering about the recipe. It‚Äôs unbearably cute.</p><p>Felix doesn‚Äôt want to interrupt him, so he stays quiet, smiling into the pillow and waiting for Sylvain to remember the thread of the conversation.</p><p>‚ÄúAnyway! Right, you asked what I was making.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI did.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúDedue‚Äôs coming over sometime this week so I thought I‚Äôd just try ‚Äì hang on‚Ä¶‚Äù There‚Äôs the sound of a food processor for a minute or so, then Sylvain continues. ‚ÄúI thought I‚Äôd try something simple just to get the hang of it, y‚Äôknow. So I don‚Äôt embarrass myself in front of him.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHa, that‚Äôs hardly necessary,‚Äù Felix snorts. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre good at cooking and you know it. Dedue knows it too.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúHmmm‚Ä¶I think you might be biased just because I feed you all the time.‚Äù</p><p>Felix can <em>hear</em> his expression through the phone ‚Äì a huge smirk, brown eyes crinkled at the corners, probably an embarrassed blush at the compliment. It‚Äôs an extremely attractive look, and he wishes he could be there to see it.</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶Maybe. But I wouldn‚Äôt tell you it was good if it wasn‚Äôt,‚Äù Felix says.</p><p>‚ÄúYou are very blunt,‚Äù Sylvain agrees, ‚Äúbut I like that about you, Fe.‚Äù On the second half of the sentence, his voice suddenly drops, low and rough, and a bolt of heat shoots down Felix‚Äôs spine, straight to his cock.</p><p>It feels so good he has to clap a hand over his mouth to muffle a sharp moan, accidentally losing his grip on the phone and sending it tumbling to the floor.</p><p>What the fuck is <em>wrong</em> with him? There should be nothing remotely sexy about this conversation, and yet one little sentence has him squirming in his hotel bed, desperate to touch himself.</p><p>Felix picks up the phone again. Thankfully, it doesn‚Äôt seem like Sylvain heard his moan, or the crash of his phone onto the floor ‚Äì he‚Äôs still distractedly switching between telling Felix about his plans with Dedue and narrating his cooking process.</p><p>‚Äú‚Äìa lot of the recipes online looked really complicated‚Ä¶but I think I ended up accidentally picking a super vague one instead. What does a ‚Äòdash‚Äô even mean?‚Äù Sylvain pauses, running the water in the sink for a minute. ‚Äú‚ÄòCause in Faerghus, it‚Äôs like the smallest amount you can possibly add without leaving it out entirely, but ‚Äì hmm. Duscur cooking is probably closer to Almyran, right?‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúProbably,‚Äù Felix says, just so Sylvain knows he hasn‚Äôt left, but it comes out breathier than he‚Äôd like.</p><p>If Felix was smart, he <em>would </em>leave ‚Äì but he doesn‚Äôt want to suddenly hang up on Sylvain, nor does he want Sylvain to think something‚Äôs wrong if he abruptly announces he has to go.</p><p>So‚Ä¶stay and deal with it, it is.</p><p>He‚Äôs still ridiculously hard, but undressing seems like a bad idea, so Felix palms himself through his clothes instead. It‚Äôs good ‚Äì just enough to take the edge off, but not so much as to make him lose his composure.</p><p>‚ÄúOh man, this one smells really spicy, though,‚Äù Sylvain says. ‚ÄúMaybe I should just put in a little at a time and see how it goes.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúSounds like a good plan.‚Äù Felix‚Äôs voice comes out remarkably steady this time. Maybe he does still have a thread of self-control, after all.</p><p>‚Ä¶But then Sylvain promptly snaps the thread, because of course Felix just had to jinx himself.</p><p>‚Äú<em>Mmmmm</em>, fuck,‚Äù Sylvain groans. ‚ÄúThat is‚Ä¶<em>really</em> good. Wish you were here to try this, Fe. I think you‚Äôd love the spices.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs moan of pleasure from tasting the food sounds exactly like the ones from the audio, and Felix bites the pillow, trying not to gasp as his hips jump up, pressing his cock firmly into his hand.</p><p>It doesn‚Äôt help that Sylvain‚Äôs voice has gotten all deep again, and that the soft way he says the nickname hits Felix right in the chest, causing a swell of affection to rush through him, somehow intensifying his arousal.</p><p>Felix doesn‚Äôt think he can keep quiet any longer, so he grabs his phone, hurriedly says ‚ÄúGive me a few minutes, be right back,‚Äù and hits the mute button.</p><p>There‚Äôs no response when he says Sylvain‚Äôs name a couple times just to check that he‚Äôs truly muted, so he abandons the phone in favor of freeing his aching cock from his pants.</p><p>What he wouldn‚Äôt give to be at home right now; to be in a world where he could wrap his arms around Sylvain‚Äôs waist while he cooks. A world where he could tease Sylvain with gentle touches, press up against him, and rile him up until he couldn‚Äôt resist fucking Felix right there in their kitchen.</p><p>It‚Äôs too bad Felix didn‚Äôt bring lube with him so he could finger himself‚Ä¶the image of Sylvain bending him over a counter has him aching to be filled. But he did say he‚Äôd only be gone for a few minutes, so it‚Äôs probably good that he didn‚Äôt.</p><p>Instead, Felix slides two fingers into his own mouth, pressing down on the back of his tongue, imagining that they‚Äôre Sylvain‚Äôs. It‚Äôs only a moment before they‚Äôre spit-slick and dripping.</p><p>He reaches down to spread the wetness over his hole, and the sensation is <em>electric</em>. A broken moan tears from Felix‚Äôs throat, and he starts circling the slickness around his rim, jerking his cock quick and rough with his other hand.</p><p>Being taken from behind is doubly appealing when Felix imagines Sylvain draped over his back, fully pressed against him, chin resting on his shoulder and breathing right into his ear...he imagines hearing Sylvain‚Äôs moans, his stuttered sentences, his hot and heavy gasps, every noise making it so clear that Sylvain wants this. Wants <em>him</em>.</p><p>‚Ä¶Sylvain would be so irritatingly smug if he ever learned how much Felix loves his voice. But in this fantasy world, Felix would risk telling him, just to be able to hear things like <em>I like that about you, Fe</em>, over and over again.</p><p>
  <em>You‚Äôre mine, and I‚Äôm yours‚Ä¶</em>
</p><p>
  <em>I‚Äôd love to get my hands on you‚Ä¶just press and press into you‚Ä¶</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Love how you feel‚Ä¶s‚Äôperfect, like you were made for me‚Ä¶</em>
</p><p>The heat builds and builds with each memory of Sylvain‚Äôs voice, ragged and rough and breathless with pleasure, and Felix is so lost in the sound of it, he hardly realizes he‚Äôs been chanting Sylvain‚Äôs name on every thrust ‚Äì until his vision is whiting out, and he‚Äôs gasping and coming hard, undone by a familiar phrase.</p><p>
  <em>Need you‚Ä¶love you.</em>
</p><p>It‚Äôs almost as intense as the last time, but in a subtly different way ‚Äì there‚Äôs a swell of emotion overcoming him that doesn‚Äôt fade after his climax, and the hotel room feels abruptly cold and lonely, even though sleeping alone has never bothered Felix before.</p><p>Goddess, he is in <em>so</em> much trouble.</p><p>The call with Sylvain is still going as Felix cleans himself up and slides under the covers, and Felix can hear him working in the kitchen, chopping something and humming a tune that matches the rhythm of his knife. Already, the room seems a little warmer again.</p><p>It‚Äôs only been five minutes since Felix muted himself, so at least he hasn‚Äôt kept Sylvain waiting long. He announces his return with a muffled ‚ÄúM‚Äôback,‚Äù from underneath the covers, which makes Sylvain laugh.</p><p>‚ÄúFeliiiix. Were you getting ready for bed? You don‚Äôt have to stay up with me, y‚Äôknow,‚Äù he says.</p><p>‚ÄúI know,‚Äù Felix mumbles. ‚ÄúKeep telling me about the food.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain obliges, a smile in his voice, and continues his narration. If Felix closes his eyes, it‚Äôs easy to pretend he‚Äôs at home on the couch, listening to Sylvain work.</p><p>Slowly, with the warmth of Sylvain‚Äôs voice filling his hotel room from miles and miles away, Felix drifts into a dreamless sleep.</p>

  <p>Tuesday passes by in a blur.</p><p>In the morning, Felix is miraculously able to find a coffee shop that‚Äôs willing to let him spread out piles of paper across several tables. Even if their espresso isn‚Äôt half as good as Annette‚Äôs, the baristas don‚Äôt bat an eye when he orders multiple refills, and even give him a discount, so Felix ends up spending almost the entire day there, from an hour after they open all the way until closing time.</p><p>As he leaves, he drops a sizable wad of cash in the tip jar. The firm‚Äôs given him a ridiculously large daily travel allowance, so it only makes sense to reward the people who‚Äôve had to put up with him all day ‚Äì especially since he usually spends less on food for an entire <em>month</em> than what he‚Äôs been allotted for this week alone.</p><p>But speaking of food‚Ä¶Felix distantly realizes that he hasn‚Äôt actually eaten anything today besides a single savory scone and copious amounts of coffee.</p><p>Between the drudgery of having to scour through paper files for relevant information instead of just using ctrl+f on a PDF, and a four-hour meeting with the client in the middle of the day, he frankly hasn‚Äôt had the time to eat anything more substantial. Still doesn‚Äôt have the time, really ‚Äì he still has so much to get through tonight if he wants to be able to answer the client‚Äôs questions at tomorrow‚Äôs meeting ‚Äì but there‚Äôs a familiar voice in his head that isn‚Äôt going to let him get away with not having a proper meal.</p><p>
  <em>You have to take care of yourself, Fe‚Ä¶Fine, fine, I know you don‚Äôt like ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù on cooking, so how about this? I definitely have the spare time, so if I make you dinner will you eat it?‚Ä¶Even if there‚Äôs vegetables? Don‚Äôt look at me like that, I promise I can make them not disgusting!</em>
</p><p>After Sylvain moved in, Felix had ordered takeout for most of the first week to make it easier for Sylvain to come out of hiding and eat. Despite that, Sylvain soon discovered that his usual diet consisted mostly of protein shakes, eggs, meat, and hot sauce, and promptly insisted on cooking ‚Äòreal food‚Äô to prevent Felix from ‚Äòcollapsing from malnutrition.‚Äô</p><p>Once Felix had given in to Sylvain‚Äôs demands, it became apparent that his dislike of vegetables stemmed from his father‚Äôs complete lack of cooking skills ‚Äì not through any fault of the vegetables themselves. Sylvain‚Äôs method of roasting fresh vegetables and seasoning them with plenty of spice was a <em>completely</em> different experience from Rodrigue‚Äôs lightly salted, microwaved canned vegetables.</p><p>When Felix tasted the roasted broccoli and declared it ‚Äúactually pretty good,‚Äù Sylvain‚Äôs smile had lit up the room, and the blush spreading across his cheeks at the praise made Felix want to hug him.</p><p>The memory sends warmth through Felix‚Äôs body and a soft smile to his face. He supposes he can avoid the temptation to simply stock up on beef jerky from the convenience store, at least for tonight.</p><p>If he gets takeout, it shouldn‚Äôt take up too much extra time ‚Äì downtown Hrym is brimming with restaurants, even on the short walk back to the hotel.</p><p>Sure enough, it takes him only a few minutes to spot a restaurant that appears to serve something sufficiently spicy. While he‚Äôs waiting for his food to be prepared, Felix checks the texts he missed during the day.</p><p>Most of them are from Sylvain, including a few from last night, which he vaguely remembers reading while still half-asleep this morning, and apparently never responded to.</p><p><br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (1:32am): u fell asleep on me!!</p>
  <p>Sylvain (1:32am): i kept the call going tho bc ur snores r too cute to miss</p>
  <p>Sylvain (1:33am): scold me in the morning if u must</p>
  <p>Sylvain (1:33am): but i maintain it was worth it :)</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Felix scoffs. He‚Äôs not a cat, how can his snores be cute? Also, he should probably find it weird that Sylvain didn‚Äôt hang up after he fell asleep, but‚Ä¶the thought is actually strangely comforting, just like a long distance version of their normal routine.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (07:50am): im meeting a new author today and seteth told me to bump up the young and hip vibes</p>
  <p>Sylvain (07:51am): well obvs not in those exact words but</p>
  <p>Sylvain (07:51am): u get what i mean</p>
  <p>Sylvain (07:52am): i guess that‚Äôs what she said she was looking for in an editor?</p>
  <p>Sylvain (07:53am): [picture attached]</p>
  <p>Sylvain (07:53am): so what do u think??</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The timestamp difference between these texts and the ones from last night is a bit concerning ‚Äì Sylvain can‚Äôt have gotten more than six hours of sleep, especially if he‚Äôs put care into his appearance.</p><p>‚Ä¶Which he most certainly has. Felix‚Äôs mouth immediately runs dry upon opening the attachment ‚Äì it‚Äôs a mirror selfie of Sylvain, posing for the camera with his hand on his hip and looking cocky and stupidly attractive.</p><p>Felix is pretty sure his heart would seize up over almost any picture of Sylvain, but he has to admit ‚Äì this outfit in particular does look good. <em>Really</em> good.</p><p>‚Ä¶Too good to be professional, in fact ‚Äì how is this even appropriate for work? Felix highly doubts Seteth intended ‚Äòyoung and hip‚Äô to mean ‚Äòmake everyone want to undress you with their eyes.‚Äô If Felix were Sylvain‚Äôs new client, they‚Äôd get absolutely nothing done ‚Äì hard to work with someone whose brain has been turned to mush from thoughts of bending Sylvain over his desk.</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs wearing a perfectly tailored white button-up with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, somehow emphasizing his forearms and his hands at the same time. Goddess, have his hands always been that big?</p><p>If Felix held Sylvain‚Äôs hand, would his own hand practically disappear, enveloped in Sylvain‚Äôs palm like his phone is in the picture? He hopes so. It sounds nice, comforting ‚Äì like how Sylvain wraps him up with his whole body when they hug.</p><p>Fuck, he‚Äôs getting too sappy. Time to focus back on the picture.</p><p>Only the top button on the shirt is undone, so at least Sylvain isn‚Äôt actually trying to look seductive ‚Äì not that that‚Äôs helping Felix at all.</p><p>Another thing that definitely isn‚Äôt helping is <em>that</em> pair of slacks. The ones that must have been imported from hell itself ‚Äì there‚Äôs no other explanation for how they‚Äôve clearly been designed specifically to torment Felix. Sylvain‚Äôs ass and thighs look incredible in them ‚Äì it‚Äôs not obvious from the angle of the picture, but Felix‚Äôs memory generously supplies a high-definition slideshow of images to remind him.</p><p>The first time Sylvain had worn them, Felix couldn‚Äôt stop daydreaming about spending hours between his legs ‚Äì it was so frustrating that he‚Äôd been sorely tempted to steal them, or burn them, or buy Sylvain five more pairs. But he‚Äôd done none of the above, and look where that‚Äôs gotten him: sitting in a dim restaurant lobby half a continent away with a steadily growing hard-on.</p><p>As if all that wasn‚Äôt enough, Sylvain‚Äôs also wearing his most ‚Äúhipster‚Äù pair of glasses, the ones with large rectangular lenses and a thick, chunky frame. Sylvain‚Äôs dubbed them his ‚Äúleast dorky‚Äù glasses, but that vastly underestimates their appeal. The black of the frame makes Sylvain‚Äôs brown eyes look even warmer than usual, and the size of the lenses means it‚Äôs still easy to see the laugh lines that crinkle the corners of his eyes when he‚Äôs genuinely smiling ‚Äì like he is in the picture.</p><p>Felix can‚Äôt help but to run a finger over the screen, feeling affectionate and aroused in equal measure, before saving the picture and returning back to the text conversation. There‚Äôll be plenty of time to fantasize later, when he isn‚Äôt in public.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (12:50pm): o shit i forgot u were gonna be super busy this week</p>
  <p>Sylvain (12:50pm): u probably didn‚Äôt even take a lunch did u</p>

  <p>Sylvain (12:55pm): oooooh or i could bribe glenn to do it, he‚Äôs much more threatening</p>
</blockquote><p>

</p><p>Apparently the Sylvain in Felix‚Äôs head telling him to eat a real dinner was completely accurate.</p><p>It should be irritating, to have someone fuss over him like this. Honestly, if it were anyone else, Felix would tell them to mind their own business ‚Äì he‚Äôs perfectly capable of taking care of himself.</p><p>But with Sylvain‚Ä¶it‚Äôs hard not to feel more fond than annoyed. After all, Felix worries about him in the same way, or at least close. While Sylvain is usually good about eating regularly, he has a harder time with sleep ‚Äì as evidenced by last night ‚Äì and Felix will definitely be pestering him about it once he‚Äôs ready to respond to everything.</p><p>

  <p>Sylvain (6:10pm): FELIX LOOK AT THEM</p>
  <p>Sylvain (6:10pm): they trapped me as soon as i got home and haven‚Äôt budged since</p>
  <p>Sylvain (6:12pm): i never get double cuddles, this feels weird tbh</p>
  <p>Sylvain (6:12pm): i mean, it‚Äôs nice, and obvs adorable, but</p>
  <p>Sylvain (6:15pm): gotta say i don‚Äôt like that it‚Äôs bc ur not here :((((((</p>
  <p>Sylvain (6:16pm): now i see what u meant abt the apt feeling too big for one person :/</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The second picture is a shot of Sylvain‚Äôs legs, now in pajama pants, with Spook curled up in his lap and Lumi stretched out to her full length down his calves, her nose nuzzled into Spook‚Äôs back and tail tickling one of Sylvain‚Äôs feet. Once the cats settle in, they can easily stay put for hours, so it‚Äôs entirely possible Sylvain is still trapped at this very moment, and Felix snorts at the thought.</p><p>As for the rest of the texts‚Ä¶he doesn‚Äôt know quite how he should feel about them. Felix knows firsthand that noticing the emptiness of his apartment is not a pleasant feeling, and it would obviously be better if Sylvain didn‚Äôt have to experience it ‚Äì but he can‚Äôt help but be just a little pleased that between this and leaving the call going even after he fell asleep, Sylvain seems to miss him too.</p><p>That‚Äôs the end of Sylvain‚Äôs messages for now, but Felix doesn‚Äôt want to respond just yet ‚Äì especially in regards to the selfie. It‚Äôs better if he takes a little time to think over his reply enough that he doesn‚Äôt inadvertently say something idiotic or horny, or both‚Ä¶in the meantime, he might as well catch up on his other notifications.</p><p>Hilda‚Äôs texts are also lengthy, and considerably more annoying than Sylvain‚Äôs, but they‚Äôre fast enough to respond to.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Hilda (11:01am): sooooo holst told me i‚Äôm not allowed at your little reunion lunch! and I just want to say‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Hilda (11:02am): you are a lifesaver THANK YOU!!!</p>
  <p>Hilda (11:04am): he acted like it was this huge insult but i would actually die if i had to listen to him and glenn talk about our dating lives for one more second</p>
  <p>Hilda (11:05am): so in exchange for this wonderful favor i have a tiiiiiny piece of advice for you</p>
  <p>Hilda (11:05am): JUST ASK THEM OUT ALREADY!!!! okay byeeeee &lt;3</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:28pm): It wasn‚Äôt a favor just for you, so advice is unnecessary. But perhaps you should take your own.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>At least Hilda hasn‚Äôt figured out who he‚Äôs crushing on yet ‚Äì all of F√≥dlan would know within a day if she had, and Felix would never hear the end of it. He doesn‚Äôt know who she‚Äôs into either, but like recognizes like, and if he‚Äôs right, hopefully his message is blunt enough to end the conversation.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Ashe (2:14pm): Hi Felix! Hope your travels are going well!</p>
  <p>Ashe (2:17pm): The studio right by the shelter is holding metalworking classes starting next month: Wednesdays at 6 and Sundays at noon. They‚Äôve got signup sheets on the door, do you want me to write you in?</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:31pm): Is one class on both days, or only Wed/only Sun each week?</p>
</blockquote><p>¬†</p><p>Felix actually has several more questions about the class, but Ashe is being considerate enough offering to sign him up, so he can wait and find out on his own. After a few minutes with no response, he sends a follow-up so Ashe won‚Äôt be kept waiting even if Felix is busy for the rest of the night.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:35pm): If it‚Äôs both days, no. If it‚Äôs either one, yes, and I don‚Äôt care which day. Thanks for telling me about it, it sounds interesting.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The last of his notifications are from the group chat he shares with Sylvain, Ingrid, and Dimitri. Ingrid has sent a flood of pictures documenting her and Dorothea‚Äôs sightseeing adventures ‚Äì Dimitri‚Äôs been diligently replying to each and every one of them, but Sylvain‚Äôs been uncharacteristically quiet, especially compared to how many texts he‚Äôs sent Felix. There‚Äôs only a ‚Äúu both look like ur having a ton of fun!! can‚Äôt wait to hear all abt it when ur back &lt;3‚Äù and a few emoji reactions, not a single witty comment to be seen.</p><p>It‚Äôs possible Sylvain really does want to wait to meet Ingrid in person, considering how little they‚Äôve seen each other lately, but Felix is still worried it‚Äôs because he‚Äôs overworking or exhausted, or both.</p><p>He decides to just say as little as possible about the phone call and the selfie in favor of texting Sylvain back faster ‚Äì the earlier he responds, the earlier Sylvain will go to bed. Hopefully.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:45pm): Human snores aren‚Äôt cute. It was probably one of the cats you were hearing.</p>
  <p>Felix (7:45pm): The outfit is fine. How did the meeting go?</p>
  <p>Felix (7:47pm): I am eating, waiting for takeout to be ready right now. Besides, if you force fed me I‚Äôd have to find a way to force you to sleep. Don‚Äôt stay up so late tonight.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Felix pauses, still not quite sure what to say to Sylvain‚Äôs thoughts on the lonely emptiness of the apartment. There‚Äôs not much he can do to help from across the country, and just commenting on the cats and ignoring that part of the conversation feels too cold.</p><p>Of course, because this is the worst possible moment to leave Sylvain hanging for another twenty minutes, it‚Äôs also the moment that his food is ready.</p><p>After Felix pays, he lingers in the lobby for a few more moments to send one more text. The host almost immediately starts clearing her throat, but he ignores her ‚Äì so what if he‚Äôs blocking one of the doors? It‚Äôs not like there‚Äôs a huge line of customers, or any line for that matter.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (7:54pm): Bad timing, food‚Äôs ready now. I‚Äôll respond to the rest when I‚Äôm back at the hotel</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>On the walk back, the spicy smell wafting up from his food reminds him that Dedue was supposed to be coming over sometime this week to cook with Sylvain. Had that already happened? If not, maybe it‚Äôll make the apartment feel less empty when he does visit.</p><p>By the time Felix gets back in his hotel room, Sylvain still hasn‚Äôt responded, not even a singular emoji of acknowledgment, which is‚Ä¶concerning. Sylvain‚Äôs usually never far from his phone, and combined with his lackluster response to Ingrid‚Ä¶</p><p>Well, there‚Äôs no sense in overreacting before he knows what‚Äôs going on. He‚Äôll send his last few messages and eat dinner first, and if Sylvain hasn‚Äôt texted back by the time he‚Äôs done, Felix will just call him‚Ä¶never mind that it‚Äôs supremely awkward to call twice in two days.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (8:22pm): Back now.</p>
  <p>Felix (8:22pm): Cute picture, and sorry about the apt. Hopefully cooking with Dedue will help, if you haven‚Äôt already done that.</p>
  <p>Felix (8:24pm): If you want more company I‚Äôm sure Ashe would come visit. He misses the cats. Or obviously Dimitri.</p>
  <p>Felix (8:25pm): Or Annette and Mercedes.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Fuck, he‚Äôs rambling now. Time to wrap it up.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (8:27pm): Point is, feel free to invite over whoever you want.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Food on one side of the desk and laptop on the other, Felix opens up his notes on the case, making a mental list of what still needs to be done tonight.</p><p>It‚Äôs hard to focus when he can‚Äôt stop thinking about Sylvain, though. His eyes keep drifting to his phone, waiting for it to light up with a notification.</p><p>After a torturous few minutes, it finally does, and Felix almost knocks the food all over the floor in his haste to grab it.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (8:39pm): hey hey sry for the delay! i was</p>
  <p>Sylvain (8:39pm): working on a project u might say</p>

  <p>Sylvain (8:42 pm): hahaha now that ur sufficiently annoyed by my awful rhymes, u won‚Äôt be more annoyed by me saying:</p>

  <p>Felix (8:43pm): You‚Äôre right, the rhyming is worse. But only just barely.</p>

</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>‚Ä¶Well. Felix only meant that he‚Äôd ask Annette or Mercedes to pester Sylvain about sleeping if Sylvain asked Glenn to pester him about eating, but the winky faces have him imagining something much more interesting.</p><p>He wouldn‚Äôt be averse to it either, if it meant something like pinning Sylvain to his bed and bringing him to the edge over and over again, winding him up so thoroughly that he can‚Äôt help but pass out after he finally comes. Even better if Felix gets to hold him afterwards, and if Sylvain feels safe enough to sleep through the night without waking up for once.</p><p>‚Ä¶But, since it doesn‚Äôt mean that, Felix has just wasted five minutes fantasizing about it when he could have been working or responding to Sylvain‚Äôs messages.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (8:47pm): dedue is coming over tomorrow! itll be fun for sure, but im not sure it will help with the general vibe of the apt? since hes still going to leave at the end of the night u know</p>
  <p>Sylvain (8:48pm): and thank u for the offer but. the person i want to invite over is currently unavailable :((((</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The last message solidifies just how impossible the fantasy is, and Felix suddenly feels unreasonably irritated ‚Äì mostly with himself.</p><p>Why did he say Sylvain could have ‚Äòanyone he wanted‚Äô over? And why is he so curious about who Sylvain wants to invite when he knows it will just upset him?</p><p>Ugh. It‚Äôll only distract him for the rest of the night if he doesn‚Äôt ask.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (8:55pm): Even if she‚Äôll never be as good as Bernie, she‚Äôll get much closer to that quality with you working on it. Is it a lot more work to be the lead editor?</p>

</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (8:58pm): aww thanks!!! i feel very touched‚Ä¶it‚Äôs mostly bernie who makes it good but if u think my editing helps that much‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Sylvain (8:59pm): well u don‚Äôt give compliments lightly so</p>
  <p>Sylvain (8:59pm): thanks Fe &lt;3</p>
  <p>Sylvain (8:59pm): and hmmm well</p>

  <p>Sylvain (9:02pm): ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and starts with an h</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>‚Ä¶Oh.</p><p>It‚Äôs <em>him</em>?</p><p>Sylvain would really rather have Felix over than anyone else? Even though they live in the same house and see each other all the time‚Ä¶?</p><p>That‚Äôs ‚Äì that‚Äôs basically the same as admitting he misses Felix, which is‚Ä¶<em>so</em> much to handle, given that Felix just steeled himself for hearing about Sylvain‚Äôs desire to see literally anyone else.</p><p>Fuck. His heart is racing so fast he can feel his pulse in the pads of his fingers. The heart emoji certainly isn‚Äôt helping either.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (9:04pm): ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ur not typing so im wondering if that was enough hints or not??</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>It takes Felix much longer than usual to compose a response with all the corrections he has to make, hands still shaking with exhilaration.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (9:09pm): I don‚Äôt think it counts as ‚Äòinviting me over‚Äô since it‚Äôs my hose?</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>And of course, there‚Äôs still a typo which he only notices after he‚Äôs already hit send. Groaning, Felix spins in the desk chair and launches himself onto the bed, stuffing his face into the comforter.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (9:10pm): UR HOSE</p>
  <p>Sylvain (9:12pm): FELIX I AM DYING U HAVE KILLED ME</p>
  <p>Sylvain (9:13pm): please do tell me more about ur hose!!!!!!</p>
  <p>Sylvain (9:13pm): ahahaha fuck my stomach hurts now from laughing</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Felix can‚Äôt help but laugh too, not at the ridiculous typo, but from imagining Sylvain‚Äôs cackling when he gets this kind of goofy-tired. Sometimes it goes on for so long he starts wheezing, which makes him laugh even more, which turns the wheezing into honking, which only perpetuates the vicious and adorable cycle of laughter.</p><p>If a typo is enough to amuse Sylvain to that extent‚Ä¶well, maybe Felix should stop proofreading his texts so carefully.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (9:15pm): It wasn‚Äôt *that* funny. But I‚Äôm glad you were amused :)</p>
  <p>Felix (9:15pm): I have to get back to work though, need to finish everything before the end of the week if I don‚Äôt want the trip to get extended.</p>
  <p>Felix (9:16pm): Go to bed soon and catch up on sleep.</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Sylvain (9:17pm): i will try! u shouldnt stay up too late either tho!!!</p>
  <p>Sylvain (9:18pm): gnight Fe &lt;3 sweet dreams!!!</p>
</blockquote><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (9:18pm): Good night, Sylvain. Sleep well.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The smile on Felix‚Äôs face doesn‚Äôt fade at all while he works, nor even when he finally falls into bed around midnight, exhausted from the long day. His cheeks are hurting with it, but it can‚Äôt be helped ‚Äì the high of making Sylvain laugh and knowing that he wishes Felix were home is simply too exhilarating.</p><p>Friday can‚Äôt come soon enough.</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>Felix wakes with a start from pleasant dreams when his first alarm goes off. The details are already fading, but he remembers a flash of red hair, soft brown eyes crinkled with laughter, then dark and shining with lust. The feeling of running his fingers over warm freckled skin, and a deep sense of <em>home</em>.</p><p>The hotel room is intensely disappointing in comparison.</p><p>For a moment, Felix considers just going back to sleep and hoping that the dream will continue, but if he dawdles for too long and gets behind schedule, he might not be able to go home on Friday, which is completely unacceptable.</p><p>Actually, another unacceptable thing is that the dream had been soundless, and therefore lacking Sylvain‚Äôs voice‚Ä¶not calling him last night has left Felix feeling a little deprived.</p><p>Also, now that he thinks of it ‚Äì yesterday was technically the first day since Sylvain moved in that he hadn‚Äôt heard his voice at all, and it sadly won‚Äôt be the last. Sylvain was already shocked enough the first time he called, and Felix doesn‚Äôt trust himself to not blurt out something ridiculously sappy, or ‚Äì possibly worse ‚Äì repress the sappiness so hard that he ends up swinging around to rudeness instead.</p><p>Though ‚Äì he does have 15 minutes until he really has to get out of bed. There‚Äôs no sense in making himself wait until Friday night to listen to Sylvain again when there‚Äôs a perfectly good solution at his fingertips.</p><p>Unlocking his phone, Felix turns off his second and third alarms before opening up @galoot_of_ill_repute‚Äôs user profile, blood thrumming in anticipation.</p><p>There aren‚Äôt any new posts since the audio he‚Äôd listened to on Saturday, which is disappointing but probably for the best. He‚Äôs immensely curious to know if Sylvain‚Äôs been recording anything while he‚Äôs been in Hrym, but he doubts he‚Äôd be able to resist the temptation of listening to something new, regardless of its length and potential to destroy his schedule.</p><p>For now, Felix just checks the length of the posts he hadn‚Äôt listened to, skimming the summaries and looking for the shortest one, which ends up being a 13-minute script fill about old friends reconnecting at a mutual friend‚Äôs wedding.</p><p>It‚Äôs probably impossible to beat the quality of the script Sylvain wrote himself, but Felix supposes it‚Äôs still worth a try. It is Sylvain, after all ‚Äì even if the writing is terrible, his noises of pleasure are definitely hot enough to make up for it.</p><p>Rolling onto his stomach, Felix clicks the link, smushing his face into the pillow to achieve optimal listening focus.</p><p>‚ÄúHey all, hope you‚Äôre doing well. I know it‚Äôs been a while since the last post, but things have been a little crazy on my end, haha.‚Äù</p><p>Just two sentences in and Felix is already feeling more relaxed, tension he didn‚Äôt know he had easing out of him as he sinks further into the bed.</p><p>‚ÄúToday I‚Äôm doing a fill for user SpeedReid. They requested me specifically for some reason, so‚Ä¶hope I do right by your script, SpeedReid!‚Äù Sylvain says, sounding genuinely confused at being requested, which is‚Ä¶quite honestly ridiculous.</p><p>‚ÄòFor some reason‚Äô<em>‚Ä¶</em>how does he not know that it‚Äôs because his voice is amazing?</p><p>Felix is biased, sure, but even from a purely technical standpoint, he thinks most strangers would find it objectively pleasant, and Sylvain‚Äôs always been good at reading aloud, making stories come alive with the emotion infused in his words.</p><p>And while he doesn‚Äôt particularly like to imagine it, Felix also knows he can‚Äôt be the only person in the world who wants to listen to Sylvain getting himself off ‚Äì it‚Äôs simply undeniably hot.</p><p>So‚Ä¶<em>of course</em> this person would request him to read their script.</p><p>He wishes there was some way to boost Sylvain‚Äôs confidence without revealing himself‚Ä¶maybe he could create an account to comment on the posts? Sylvain already gets plenty of compliments in the comments, though ‚Äì how much would one more anonymous reply help? It‚Äôs something to consider later, but for now, Felix focuses back on the audio.</p><p>The murmuring voices of a crowd begin fading in slowly, setting the scene without being jarring. It sounds like much too large of a wedding for Felix‚Äôs tastes.</p><p>‚ÄúExcuse me‚Ä¶pardon me, sorry, trying to get through,‚Äù Sylvain says, sounding rushed, like whatever he‚Äôs looking for will disappear if he doesn‚Äôt get there in time. ‚ÄúOn your left‚Ä¶‚Äôscuse me‚Ä¶<em>whew, finally!</em>‚Äù He mutters the last bit under his breath, then clears his throat and takes a steadying breath before continuing.</p><p>‚ÄúHey! There you are, I‚Äôve been looking for you all night!‚Äù he exclaims, then sucks in a sharp breath through his teeth. ‚ÄúOh, shit, I didn‚Äôt mean to startle you ‚Äì now you‚Äôve got wine all over your clothes.‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs a clink of a glass being set down. ‚ÄúI am so sorry. I promise I‚Äôll pay for the cleaning‚Ä¶ah, what a way to reintroduce myself, haha. Haven‚Äôt seen you for years and I‚Äôm already making a mess of things.‚Äù Sylvain laughs a little self-deprecatingly, then pauses for the illusion of dialogue.</p><p>So far, Felix isn‚Äôt too fond of the way this script mirrors Sylvain‚Äôs lack of confidence from the intro ‚Äì maybe even induced it? ‚Äì but he‚Äôs hardly a minute in and too eager to hear more of Sylvain to stop now.</p><p>‚ÄúOh! Haha, well, I‚Äôm glad I haven‚Äôt already scared you away then.‚Äù Sylvain says, a touch of nervousness coming through his otherwise flirtatious tone.</p><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really good to see you too ‚Äì you look great. Seriously. The years have been good to you. Even the wine stains don‚Äôt make you any less gorgeous ‚Äì in fact, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it became a new fashion trend. And here I am, unremarkable as always.‚Äù</p><p>Again with the self-deprecation ‚Äì Felix kind of wants to slap the writer of this script. It‚Äôs hopefully just acting, but Sylvain still sounds sincere enough that it hurts to hear him talk like this.</p><p>Feeling irritated and protective, Felix can‚Äôt help but fill in his own reply in the pause Sylvain leaves for the other character‚Äôs response.</p><p>‚ÄúShut up,‚Äù he mumbles. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre amazing, so stop talking like that.‚Äù</p><p>It feels strange, flushing his cheeks hot with embarrassment, but it does relieve a little of his frustration. If only he could work up the nerve to tell Sylvain things like that in real life.</p><p>‚ÄúHah, really?‚Äù Sylvain replies after a moment. ‚ÄúI just feel older, not more handsome. But‚Ä¶thanks.‚Äù His voice is a little rough, and he clears his throat before continuing, putting on that tone of fake-nonchalance he always uses to deflect.</p><p>‚ÄúSo, how have things been? Enjoying the night so far? Gotta say, I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be here‚Ä¶I thought you weren‚Äôt keeping in touch with the happy couple these days. Or, y‚Äôknow, any of our old friend group. I ‚Äì <em>we</em> really missed you, though, so I‚Äôm glad you are. Here, that is.‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs a pause, then Sylvain gasps sharply in surprise, and Felix shivers at the sound, hips rocking into the sheets.</p><p>‚ÄúW-what? You only decided to come because‚Ä¶<em>I</em> was going to be here?‚Äù The disbelief in Sylvain‚Äôs voice is palpable, all shaky breaths and wavering words.</p><p>‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶missed me too, and‚Ä¶me <em>most of all</em>? Holy shit. I-I don‚Äôt know what to say, this, this is ‚Äì mmmmmfffh!‚Äù His sentence cuts off with a drawn-out, muffled moan, then ‚Äì <em>fuck</em> ‚Äì hurried, enthusiastic kissing noises.</p><p>Felix swears softly, stifling a moan of his own as he thrusts his hips against the bed. How many times has he dreamed of breaking Sylvain out of his anxious ramblings with a kiss? So. Fucking. Many.</p><p>Clutching the pillow tight in a poor approximation of pulling Sylvain closer, Felix imagines straddling him, grinding into his lap fully clothed and devouring his mouth like it‚Äôs the end of the world.</p><p>The delicious friction of fabric against his cock as he ruts into the sheets only intensifies the illusion, and Sylvain‚Äôs desperate, needy sounds shoot through his body like lightning, electrifying every nerve.</p><p>Would Sylvain really be this noisy just from kissing? Or is he imagining something more intense like Felix is‚Ä¶fingers tugging on his hair, lips pressing against his neck, hands palming his perfect ass, legs wrapped around his waist? Whatever it is, it must be working for him, because when he finally breaks the kiss to speak, he sounds <em>debauched</em>, voice wobbly and breathless.</p><p>‚ÄúOh fuck,‚Äù Sylvain gasps. ‚ÄúPlease, tell me this is real, you have <em>no</em> idea how long I‚Äôve wanted to kiss you ‚Äì hah! Ngh, yes, okay, we should definitely take this somewhere more private‚Ä¶Hmm, what‚Äôs that?‚Äù</p><p>The sound of footsteps echoing on a hard floor fills the silence as Sylvain pauses for a response.</p><p>‚Äú‚Ä¶You want to find a bathroom to ‚Äòsoak the wine stains, and maybe soak my dick too‚Äô?‚Äù Sylvain emphasizes the phrase so the air quotes are obvious, makes a strangled choking sound, then promptly bursts into laughter.</p><p>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs ‚Äì hahahaha, fuck, I can‚Äôt ‚Äì !‚Äù He‚Äôs cackling so hard he starts to wheeze, and Felix grins, cheeks flushed with affection and arousal. This is the kind of laughter he was imagining last night when Sylvain cracked up at his typo, and hearing it for real rather than just from his memory makes Felix‚Äôs chest feel unbearably full.</p><p>Sylvain takes a few deep breaths to calm himself, then tries to start reading the script again. ‚ÄúWhew, okay, I think ‚Äì pfffft, hahaha, nope! Still ‚Äì ahahahaha ‚Äì not‚Ä¶done yet!‚Äù The line wasn‚Äôt even that funny, but Sylvain‚Äôs giggling is so bright and contagious that Felix can‚Äôt help but start laughing too.</p><p>It takes at least a full minute for Sylvain to fully catch his breath, and Felix is still snickering when he finally speaks again.</p><p>‚ÄúWow, I‚Äôm so sorry about that, SpeedReid,‚Äù he says, clearing his throat when his voice comes out croaky. ‚ÄúI must be in a weird mood today. I‚Äôll ask if you want me to edit out my unseemly laughter later ‚Äì so listeners, if you‚Äôre hearing this part, rest assured it‚Äôs author-approved! Anyway, we continue.‚Äù</p><p>Again, of course the author wanted to keep it in‚Ä¶who <em>wouldn‚Äôt</em> want to listen to Sylvain laughing?</p><p>‚ÄúMmm, yes, when you put it like that‚Ä¶the sooner we find a bathroom, the better. Lead the way, darling.‚Äù Sylvain‚Äôs tone of voice drops back into ‚Äòlusty‚Äô so quickly that it takes Felix by surprise, but it‚Äôs still missing the breathiness that seems to distinguish his acting from actually touching himself and reacting to how good it feels.</p><p>The sound of footsteps from earlier starts again, increasing in speed, then there‚Äôs the click of a door opening, the rattle of it closing, and then a loud thump ‚Äì which, if Sylvain‚Äôs broken moan is any indication, is the sound of him being slammed up against said door.</p><p>‚ÄúGoddess, you‚Äôre a tease,‚Äù Sylvain groans. ‚ÄúPinning me like this and then stopping just before kissing me‚Ä¶I‚Äôll just have to ‚Äì mmmmh! Fuck, you feel so good pressed up against me, this feels like a dream‚Ä¶love how you just, hah, just grab me by the hips and ‚Äì ngggh, <em>yes</em> ‚Äì put me where you want me.‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs breathing hard now between kisses, slipping back into the fantasy, and Felix‚Äôs simmering arousal bursts back into a roaring flame. It‚Äôs just <em>so</em> much better when it‚Äôs obvious Sylvain‚Äôs enjoying himself.</p><p>‚ÄúAh, ah, ah, sneaky hands there,‚Äù Sylvain says after a minute, chuckling breathlessly. ‚ÄúWhile I‚Äôm definitely not complaining, you‚Äôre technically the one covered in wine. So I think ‚Äì mmmm ‚Äì priorities dictate <em>I </em>get to undress <em>you</em> first. But I guess I, hah, can‚Äôt stop you from teasing my cock through my pants while I do, hmm?‚Äù</p><p>There‚Äôs a soft rustling of fabric, and Felix moans, suddenly remembering the selfie Sylvain sent yesterday.</p><p>Rutting against the bed in time with Sylvain‚Äôs stuttered breaths, he imagines tugging the hem of that carefully pressed button-up out from the waistband of Sylvain‚Äôs slacks, desperate to slide his hands under it and feel the warm skin at the small of Sylvain‚Äôs back...<em>fuck</em>.</p><p>Is it possible to open the photo app without interrupting the audio?</p><p>‚Ä¶It is indeed possible.</p><p>Although, maybe Felix should pretend like it isn‚Äôt, given the way his hips jerk against the bed and he almost comes in his pants immediately upon opening the selfie. Gasping, he rolls onto his back, feeling much too warm to be wearing clothes, cock throbbing from the loss of stimulation.</p><p>As Sylvain kisses and moans his way through undressing his imaginary partner, Felix pushes down his pajama pants and underwear in one go, shivering at the feeling of cool air against the pre-come smeared all over his cock and stomach.</p><p>‚ÄúMmm, now that I‚Äôve unwrapped my present‚Ä¶I wanna taste you,‚Äù Sylvain rumbles, voice thick with desire.</p><p>Any other time, he‚Äôd love to imagine Sylvain‚Äôs incredible mouth wrapped around him, swallowing him down, but right now Felix can only think about tasting Sylvain instead‚Ä¶damn that incredible, infuriating outfit.</p><p>He wants those ridiculous slacks pushed down just enough to free Sylvain‚Äôs cock ‚Äì so he can dig his fingers into the fabric stretched tight over Sylvain‚Äôs thighs as he spends hours, days, <em>years</em> on his knees, using his lips and teeth and tongue to find every single way Sylvain can fall apart under his touch.</p><p>And thank the goddess, because for once the script writer has deigned to give Sylvain something nice. There‚Äôs a thump once again, and then ‚Äì ‚ÄúAhhhh, fuck, <em>yes</em>!‚Äù he gasps. ‚ÄúOkay, yeah, it ‚Äì nnnnngh ‚Äì it can be your turn so long as, ah, ahhh! So long as you don‚Äôt stop, your mouth is incredible, I, I can‚Äôt ‚Äì please!‚Äù</p><p>Sylvain‚Äôs noises are <em>delicious</em>, wild and uninhibited, every sound sending shocks of pleasure down Felix‚Äôs spine. The fantasy of sucking Sylvain off is almost perfect ‚Äì except that there‚Äôs nothing filling his mouth, nothing hitting the back of his throat, no hands in his hair clutching tighter the more pleasure he gives.</p><p>For the second time that week, Felix wishes he‚Äôd anticipated being this sex-crazed and packed accordingly. But as it is, he has no toys to stuff his throat with, so his fingers will have to do.</p><p>Shoving three fingers in his mouth, Felix presses down on the back of his tongue, and ‚Äì oh <em>yes,</em> this definitely works.</p><p>Almost immediately, he falls into a haze of desire, the world narrowing until there‚Äôs nothing but pleasure. There‚Äôs only Felix‚Äôs hand on his cock, jerking faster and sloppier the more Sylvain loses himself; only Sylvain‚Äôs shuddering moans and the way Felix‚Äôs fingers automatically fuck into his throat like <em>he‚Äôs</em> the one dragging these noises out of Sylvain.</p><p>Like he‚Äôs really on his knees, cock-drunk and drooling for Sylvain‚Ä¶only ever Sylvain.</p><p>‚ÄúNgggh, yes, just ‚Äì <em>hah</em> ‚Äì just like that,‚Äù Sylvain says, voice rough and breathless. ‚ÄúYour noises are so fucking hot, feels so good when you ‚Äì ahhh, oh <em>fuck</em>! ‚Äì when you moan around my cock like that. You‚Äôre enjoying this...nghhhh, so much, just as much as I am, aren‚Äôt you?‚Äù</p><p><em>Yes,</em> Felix thinks, desperately moaning around his fingers.</p><p>‚ÄúOhhh, <em>fuck</em>, you‚Äôre ‚Äì ah, ahh! ‚Äì you‚Äôre touching yourself, that‚Äôs so ‚Äì ngggh, shit, so hot! You‚Äôre incredible, so good ‚Äì mm, fuck, I‚Äôm close! Hah‚Ä¶can I ‚Äì? I wanna, fuck, wanna watch you swallow‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><p>Pulling his fingers out, Felix gasps, ‚ÄúYes, come in my mouth, fuck, <em>Sylvain</em>!‚Äù, and shoves them back in, thrusting in at each of Sylvain‚Äôs moans, trying to stave off his own orgasm so they can come together.</p><p>‚ÄúSo close, fuck, you‚Äôre taking me so well, nghhh, so amazing ‚Äì <em>yes</em>, hah, like that, please, gonna come down your throat‚Ä¶oh <em>fuck</em> ‚Äì ah, ahhh, ahhh, <em>ahhhh</em>!‚Äù</p><p>Just imagining Sylvain filling his mouth with come is enough to send Felix hurtling over the edge with a muffled shout, waves of pleasure coursing through him with each of Sylvain‚Äôs stuttered moans, cock pulsing and painting the sheets white.</p><p>It takes him a minute to come back to himself, listening to Sylvain‚Äôs labored breathing as he recovers.</p><p>Pulling his fingers out of his mouth, Felix groans ‚Äì in frustration, now that he‚Äôs emerged from the fog of arousal. He‚Äôs made an absolute mess of the bed ‚Äì the pillow is drenched in drool, to say nothing of the come on the sheets, and it seems incredibly rude not to at least rinse everything before leaving it for the housekeeping staff to replace.</p><p>Sylvain interrupts his thoughts with a sleepy-sounding hum. ‚ÄúMmm, so, there‚Äôs technically two more lines of the script‚Ä¶but I‚Äôm frankly too wiped to give them a serious read, so‚Ä¶I‚Äôll just say them and try not to laugh like a maniac again.‚Äù</p><p>He pauses for dramatic effect, then says, completely deadpan, ‚ÄúWow, that was amazing, babe. You really know how to soak a guy‚Äôs dick.‚Äù</p><p>Understandably, it only takes him a couple seconds to lose the battle with laughter. ‚ÄúPfffft‚Ä¶ahahaha, oh my goddess! I just, ahahaha, do not get how that‚Äôs supposed to be sexy!‚Äù</p><p>Felix can‚Äôt help but laugh too, feeling soft and affectionate. The writing definitely leaves a lot to be desired, but he‚Äôd honestly listen to a hundred terrible scripts just to hear Sylvain like this.</p><p>‚ÄúSorry, SpeedReid. Different strokes for different folks I guess,‚Äù Sylvain says, still chuckling a little. ‚ÄúHope you and the listeners enjoyed it anyway, despite my blaspheming of the source material! Catch y‚Äôall next time.‚Äù</p><p>The audio clicks off, and Felix sighs, lingering in bed for another minute to enjoy the mood before he has to clean up and start the day.</p><p><em>Only ever Sylvain</em>‚Ä¶it sounds ridiculously sappy now, but Felix supposes it is an accurate representation of his feelings. Even if they‚Äôre never anything more than friends, Felix wouldn‚Äôt trade that friendship for the world.</p><p>Sylvain is simply‚Ä¶irreplaceable.</p><p>¬†</p><p>‚Äî</p><p>¬†</p><p>Time starts passing strangely after that. Felix is swamped with work, feeling especially motivated to finish it to ensure he can go home on time, and Sylvain is busy with editing, Dedue, and more editing, so they only have time to exchange a few texts ‚Äì but hopefully the crunch time will be worth the reward of the coming weekend.</p><p>For Felix, the hours fly by in a flurry of paperwork and case notes, thoughts of Sylvain ever present but not a distraction, and before he knows it, it‚Äôs already late morning on Thursday ‚Äì time to meet Glenn and Holst for lunch.</p><p>The restaurant is already packed by the time Felix arrives just before noon, but luckily Holst‚Äôs shock of pink hair makes it easy to spot him despite the crowd. They‚Äôve managed to snag a window booth, sun glinting off the metallic details of Glenn‚Äôs bionic arm, and they‚Äôre so engrossed in their conversation that they don‚Äôt even notice Felix until he‚Äôs sliding onto the bench across from them.</p><p>Glenn greets him with a two-fingered salute, but doesn‚Äôt have time to say anything before his fianc√© butts in, loud as ever.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, Felix! Hello! Good to see you buddy, it‚Äôs been too long!‚Äù Holst exclaims. He holds his hand out for a fist bump, and Glenn mirrors the movement with a smirk.</p><p>Felix rolls his eyes, indulging Holst first. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôd better not zap me with that thing,‚Äù he says to Glenn, jerking his chin towards his brother‚Äôs outstretched silver fist. It‚Äôs not an unreasonable concern. Glenn loves making strange modifications to his arm and pranking people with them ‚Äì Felix himself has fallen victim to the static shock handshake and water-gun wrist more times than he can count.</p><p>‚ÄúI may, I may not,‚Äù Glenn says, still grinning mischievously. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll just have to find out, won‚Äôt you.‚Äù</p><p>Sighing, Felix holds out his fist across the table. Glenn meets him with a firm tap, and he feels nothing but the cool metal against his knuckles ‚Äì apparently he has been spared today.</p><p>‚ÄúSee? That wasn‚Äôt so bad,‚Äù Glenn laughs. ‚ÄúBut you‚Äôll have to thank the big guy here for saving you from certain doom.‚Äù</p><p>Holst nods, beaming. ‚ÄúI said it would be rude and mean to prank you when we haven‚Äôt seen you for almost a year!‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúAnd you would be correct,‚Äù Felix says, nodding approvingly ‚Äì which only increases the wattage of Holst‚Äôs grin.</p><p>Holst may be irritating sometimes, but he does always have good intentions. And he makes Glenn happy, which is all that really matters.</p><p>‚ÄúAh, you two are no fun,‚Äù Glenn says, poking Holst‚Äôs arm with a mock pout. ‚ÄúSo, Fe, what have you been up to for these long, looooong 11 months?‚Äù</p><p>The server interrupts them with a round of iced water, ready to take their orders, which sparks the usual mini-argument about whether Glenn should be allowed to order the same dish literally every time they go out to eat. It‚Äôs more playful than heated, like an old married couple who‚Äôve been having similar disagreements for years, so Felix doesn‚Äôt mind ‚Äì especially since it gives him a few minutes to think over what he wants to say about the past year.</p><p>With Glenn and Holst, It‚Äôs always best to provide them with as little detail as possible and get them talking about themselves, lest they latch onto some random thing Felix says and pester him about it for the rest of lunch, or possibly eternity. The consequences of Felix‚Äôs worst slip-up still haunt him to this day: years ago, Felix had offhandedly mentioned that living in such a big apartment alone felt strange ‚Äì that was the official beginning of Holst‚Äôs matchmaking obsession. Thank the goddess Hilda wasn‚Äôt here today.</p><p>Eventually, orders are decided upon, and the conversation comes back to Felix‚Äôs life.</p><p>‚ÄúI‚Äôve just been working, mostly,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúA new gym opened up by the office, been taking kendo classes there. Annette‚Äôs coffee shop is doing well, I go there most mornings and whenever she has open mic night‚Ä¶what else.‚Äù</p><p>Felix pauses. The final piece of news is the most important update in his life, but it feels dangerously close to pestering territory. Though, it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs told Glenn about his feelings‚Ä¶It‚Äôll probably be fine.</p><p>‚ÄúOh, and Sylvain‚Äôs living at my place now.‚Äù Felix stares into his drink, hoping any emotions showing on his face can be disguised by the lack of eye contact.</p><p>Glenn huffs, shaking his head. ‚ÄúFinally.‚Äù</p><p>Felix looks up, eyes wide. Surely Glenn doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúfinally‚Äù as in ‚Äúit‚Äôs about time you two lived together‚Äù? He can‚Äôt have been that obvious already.</p><p>‚ÄúYou know, Dad‚Äôs been offering him a place to stay for years now, but he always said there was ‚Äòno point.‚Äô But better late than never, I suppose.‚Äù Glenn sighs, and Holst rests a comforting hand on his arm. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just glad he left that hellhole.‚Äù</p><p>Oh. That kind of ‚Äúfinally.‚Äù</p><p>‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know about that,‚Äù Felix says, as steadily as he can manage.</p><p>He should be relieved that his Glenn hasn‚Äôt pinpointed his crush on Sylvain with scary efficiency, but his brother‚Äôs words have conjured a cold realization that drowns out everything else.</p><p>When they were young, Felix knew that Sylvain and Miklan didn‚Äôt get along, but in his innocence he always assumed Sylvain‚Äôs fights with his brother were the same as his own fights with Glenn ‚Äì upsetting but ultimately easy to forgive.</p><p>It wasn‚Äôt until Sylvain left for college and dropped off the face of the earth for a few months that Felix truly understood the severity of Sylvain‚Äôs family situation ‚Äì Felix had texted Sylvain more and more frantically until he finally returned over break, arriving at Felix‚Äôs house with a tearful apology and overdue explanation.</p><p>Remembering the details even now threatens to choke him with emotion, and Felix blinks hard, trying to swallow down the lump in his throat.</p><p>Before that day, at least Felix had the excuse of ignorance, but it‚Äôs been more than ten years since then, and not once did Felix explicitly offer him a place to stay, a way to escape his family, before Sylvain showed up on his doorstep.</p><p>Of course, he would never have turned Sylvain away, not even when he was living in a cramped dorm room or a tiny apartment with Ingrid, but still‚Ä¶Felix knows by now that Sylvain needs words ‚Äì needs verbal reassurance that he is wanted, needs to be reminded that asking for help is not an inconvenience.</p><p>His father offered those words, and Felix did not.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>The guilt from the other day floods back in full force, and Felix suddenly feels nauseous, the smell of food inside the restaurant turning his stomach. Lurching out of his seat and toward the door, he ignores Glenn and Holst‚Äôs concerned looks, muttering something about needing fresh air and desperately hoping they won‚Äôt follow him.</p><p>Belatedly, Felix realizes the muggy downtown air probably won‚Äôt help much at all, but he heads outside anyway, leaning against the front wall of the restaurant and sliding down it until he‚Äôs sitting on the sidewalk.</p><p>The city is bright and loud ‚Äì usually something Felix does not appreciate ‚Äì but right now the constant buzz of noise is surprisingly helpful for pulling himself out of his spiralling thoughts. After a few minutes of focusing on his breathing, he feels much steadier, almost ready to head back inside.</p><p>As Felix pulls out his phone to check the time, he‚Äôs struck by a sudden urge to call Sylvain, so strong that it surprises him ‚Äì but it‚Äôs the middle of the day, Sylvain is probably working, and Felix doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôd even say.</p><p>Sorry for being a terrible friend? Not really the kind of thing you can bring up out of the blue.</p><p>Though there <em>is</em> someone he can talk to who will hopefully ease his mind.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:06pm): When you were living with my father, did you know he offered Sylvain a room at the house?</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Dimitri responds within minutes ‚Äì he must be on his lunch break too.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Dimitri (12:09pm): Yes, I believe I even passed the message on to Sylvain several times, though he always declined, and there seemed to be no way to convince him. We were quite worried about him then. Why do you ask?</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Goddess, Felix really <em>was</em> the only one who didn‚Äôt try to help. His father, Dimitri, Glenn‚Ä¶he‚Äôs sure Ingrid did too ‚Äì she of all people understood the complications of family.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:11pm): I‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt know. That he had offered.</p>
  <p>Felix (12:11pm): Or that an offer needed to be made.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The typing indicator pops up, so Felix waits a bit for Dimitri‚Äôs response, but it keeps appearing and disappearing for so long that it‚Äôs clear he‚Äôs struggling with what to say. Understandable ‚Äì Felix is too, but he‚Äôs just writing and rewriting his texts inside his head, where Dimitri can‚Äôt witness his indecision.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:16pm): You said Sylvain couldn‚Äôt be convinced.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Fuck. This is so hard to talk about, even over text ‚Äì Felix‚Äôs hands won‚Äôt stop shaking as he types. At least he knows Dimitri will be honest with him.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:17pm): Would it have been different if I had asked him?</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>Dimitri‚Äôs typing is more constant now that he has a question to answer, and true to character, a full paragraph comes through a few minutes later.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Dimitri (12:22pm): Hmm. I cannot be sure, but I do not think Sylvain would have accepted the offer from anyone, even you, Felix. I believe he still felt a sense of duty and responsibility towards his family despite what they put him through, and he may also have felt that he deserved the pain they caused him‚Ä¶a sentiment I understand well. In any case, I think he needed to come to the decision to leave in his own time ‚Äì as you have reminded me, it is difficult to help someone who does not wish to be helped. But you should take comfort in the fact that when he did take that step, it was you who he came to first. He would not have done that if he did not trust you fully, and he would not stay with you unless he wanted to.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>The wave of relief from Dimitri‚Äôs words is overpowering. He‚Äôs right ‚Äì there‚Äôs truly no reason Sylvain would have to stay with Felix if he didn‚Äôt want to. Felix isn‚Äôt like Sylvain‚Äôs family ‚Äì he isn‚Äôt blackmailing him or coercing him or guilting him into staying ‚Äì and Sylvain‚Äôs job pays enough that he could easily afford a place of his own if he wanted one.</p><p>Also, in his emotional spiral, Felix had completely forgotten about their texts from the other day. Sylvain wanting to ‚Äòinvite him over‚Äô further proves Dimitri‚Äôs point ‚Äì not only does that imply Sylvain missed him, but also that he thinks of Felix‚Äôs apartment as his own home.</p><p>Felix almost laughs at the irony ‚Äì all those years of talking Dimitri down from fits of irrational self-deprecation and blame, and now Dimitri is doing the same for him. Oddly proud, he types out a response before silencing his phone and heading back into the restaurant.</p><p>
  <br />
</p><blockquote>
  <p>Felix (12:25pm): You are the voice of reason today. Thank you.</p>
</blockquote><p>
  <br />
</p><p>When Felix gets back to their table, the food hasn‚Äôt even arrived yet. Glenn mouths <em>Okay?</em> at him as Holst summarizes what he missed of their conversation, and he nods, truly feeling better after talking with Dimitri.</p>
