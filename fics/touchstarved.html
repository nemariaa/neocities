      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Ever since Mount Tonglu, Feng Xin has been touching Mu Qing more often, and more softly, causing a swooping sensation in his stomach every time.</p><p>It’s not a <i>bad</i> feeling, necessarily, but Mu Qing can’t really tell if it’s good, either — not until a curse makes him unable to feel any touch at all, and he realizes just how much all those gentle touches have been affecting him.</p></blockquote>

  <h2 class="heading">the meddling of pei ming</h2>


</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>“Noble Jie. It’s time to put our plan into motion.”</p><p>Pei Ming’s voice rang in Ling Wen’s ear, excited and confident, and she sighed, setting down her brush and putting two fingers to her temple. It wasn’t impossible for her to multitask on her better days, but…today was not one of those days.</p><p>“<em>Our</em> plan? It’s certainly not <em>my</em> plan,” she grumbled. “I have no desire to meddle with the love lives of the generals of the south.”</p><p>Pei Ming snorted. “You can’t deny it’d make your life easier if they got their shit together, though. Anyway, you don’t need to do anything except give them a specific mission I have in mind. I’m positive they’ll handle the rest themselves.”</p><p>Pei Ming had been talking about getting General Nan Yang and General Xuan Zhen together for months now. Ever since the Heavenly Capital was rebuilt and they chose to place their new palaces directly next to each other, he’d been convinced that they’d confess to each other any day now — but it had been almost a year since then, and Ling Wen continued to be the main recipient of Pei Ming’s increasing impatience.</p><p>Personally, she thought it was extremely optimistic to expect anyone’s behavior to change significantly after 800 years, and especially unlikely for Nan Yang and Xuan Zhen in particular to suddenly become decent enough at communicating to express their feelings (regardless of how obvious those feelings were to everyone else) but she was frankly inclined to agree to help just to make Pei Ming shut up about it.</p><p>“…Fine. What is this mission?”</p><p>“Hah! I knew you’d give in!” Pei Ming’s triumphant grin was clearly audible through the communication array. “There’s a little troublemaker causing some problems in one of the villages in my territory — I’ll have one of my deputies bring you a scroll with the details. Just have General Nan Yang and General Xuan Zhen go down to take care of it.”</p><p>Ling Wen sighed again. “And if they object to doing your work for you?”</p><p>“Tell them it’s a two person job and that if one of them wants to come with me instead, I’d love to have their company.”</p><p>“What will you do if they take you up on that?”</p><p>“Hah, you know they won’t! Or would you like to make a bet on it? How about…all the merits from my territory for three months if they don’t end up going together? And if they do, you handle all my paperwork for three months.”</p><p>Ling Wen hummed, considering the offer. She could probably transfer another deputy to her palace with that amount of merits…but three months of extra paperwork was frankly not worth the risk, especially when she suspected that Pei Ming was right — Nan Yang and Xuan Zhen wouldn’t pass up a chance to work together, even if it did end up benefiting Pei Ming.</p><p>“I think I’ll pass on the bet,” she said dryly.</p><p>“Buuuut you’ll give them the mission?”</p><p>“…Yes, fine, I’ll give them the mission. If, and only if, you let me actually get some work done. Now off with you.”</p><p>“Noble Jie is truly the most magnanimous of them all,” Pei Ming said, teasing but clearly extremely pleased. “My head deputy is on the way now. See you for tea later?”</p><p>“Mm.” Ling Wen tapped her temple again to disconnect from the array, then slumped down to briefly rest her forehead against her desk.</p><p>Maybe if this scheme worked, she could convince Pei Ming to spot her enough merits for a new deputy anyway…it would be great to have a day off, or maybe two, if she could just get caught up enough on the paperwork…</p><p>There was a knock at her office door, and she straightened with a sigh, waving a hand to admit Pei Ming’s deputy and accept the scroll with the mission details.</p><p>Bracing herself for the inevitable headache, Ling Wen entered the communication array for her palace’s messengers. “Please send for Generals Xuan Zhen and Nan Yang. Let them know they are needed for a mission as soon as they are available…”</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>“General Xuan Zhen. Apologies for the interruption, but your presence is requested at the palace of Ling Wen.”</p><p>Seated at his desk and absorbed in sorting prayers, Mu Qing startled a bit at the sudden voice and looked up to see his head deputy, Yang Jinghui, looming in the doorway of his office. The doors were open, signifying that Mu Qing would allow interruptions, but he still wished that the man would move a bit less silently sometimes, or that he’d at least knock before speaking.</p><p>“Very well,” Mu Qing said, and stood up. Grabbing the basket of prayer scrolls he’d already assigned, he handed it off to Yang Jinghui. “Could you distribute these while I’m gone?”</p><p>Yang Jinghui nodded.</p><p>As they were leaving the room, Mu Qing caught him shooting a covetous look towards the rather large pile of scrolls still stacked on Mu Qing’s desk.</p><p>“No need to take care of those,” he said hurriedly, and shut the doors behind them before his deputy could object. “Just this much should keep everyone busy for a while.”</p><p>Truthfully, while Mu Qing knew he could delegate the sorting of prayers to Yang Jinghui if he wanted to, he actually enjoyed doing it himself. It was an interesting challenge to match up the tasks according to his deputies’ skillsets, but more importantly — Yang Jinghui, if left to his own devices, would leave almost no prayers for Mu Qing himself to handle.</p><p>Mu Qing knew his intentions were good — to be fair, most gods at Mu Qing’s level probably wanted to minimize the amount of grunt work they had to handle personally — but even though Yang Jinghui had been with his palace for years, Mu Qing had still been unable to convince him that yes, he really, truly wanted to take on just as many prayers as any of his deputies.</p><p>…No need for him to know that Mu Qing preferred the ones from near the eastern border of his territory.</p><p>Of course, if Yang Jinghui found out, and asked him why, Mu Qing would say that obviously it was to make sure Feng Xin wasn’t trying to push his influence too far west. And if he happened to run into Feng Xin more often due to the overlap in their territories…well, that was just to be expected.</p><p>Yang Jinghui gave him an inscrutable look. “If you’re sure,” he said. Then he took a left around the corner, leaving Mu Qing to walk to the palace entrance by himself.</p><p>The fastest way to get around the heavens without expending too much spiritual energy was the newly created network of interconnected teleportation crystals — a feature of the reconstructed capital that both Mu Qing and Feng Xin had put a significant amount of effort into helping build.</p><p>Normally, Mu Qing wouldn’t have put any special attention towards a project like that, simply helping where he was needed without going especially out of his way — but this time had been different. Mu Qing hadn’t been able to get one particular thought out of his head, and that thought was:</p><p>
  <em>If something like those crystals had existed before the fall of the capital, maybe Mu Qing wouldn’t have had to leave Feng Xin behind in the burning, collapsing capital. Maybe he would have been able to get them both out of there before Cuocuo managed to take advantage of how weak the cursed shackle had left him, making him drop Feng Xin, making him too slow to evade Cuocuo’s attacks whenever he tried to get close again.</em>
</p><p>Whatever. Mu Qing knew it didn’t matter in the end, since Feng Xin had survived. But something irrational inside him had told him that spending countless days and nights working to build the transportation network would help him erase the vivid memory of those harrowing hours where he hadn’t been sure if Feng Xin had lived or died; that it would help him exorcize the sickening dread and terror and guilt that haunted his nightmares.</p><p>Unfortunately, other than being a good excuse to avoid sleeping in the first place, finishing the project hadn’t done much for Mu Qing’s nightmares, but even so, he still felt a sense of pride every time he saw the teleportation crystals around the city. They were both beautiful and efficient, after all, and it was incredibly convenient to have one practically right outside his palace doors.</p><p>Mu Qing stepped up to the crystal and drew a symbol on it with his index finger, then placed his palm over the symbol. With only a tiny drop of his spiritual power, it lit up brightly, and with a low hum and a flash of light, he was transported directly to the crystal outside Ling Wen’s palace, on the other side of the city.</p><p>Feng Xin was already there when Mu Qing entered Ling Wen’s office, looking like he’d come directly from the training grounds. His plain sparring robes were rumpled and dirty, his hair was falling out of its signature topknot, and he was covered in a sheen of sweat.</p><p>It was…extremely distracting.</p><p>Usually he would only see Feng Xin this disheveled when they were sparring together. It was strangely disconcerting to realize that Feng Xin’s deputies probably saw him like this much more often than Mu Qing got to — and that apparently he had no qualms about waltzing into other officials’ palaces looking like this, either.</p><p>Mu Qing scoffed, hoping he didn’t look as flustered as he felt. “You couldn’t have cleaned up before coming here?”</p><p>“Fuck you, the message said ‘as soon as possible’,” Feng Xin said gruffly. “I didn’t know you were going to take your sweet time, so I came directly here.”</p><p>Mu Qing bit back his retort that he’d also left immediately upon being informed. If they got into it now they’d be bickering all day, and Ling Wen would slap them with a merit deduction for wasting her time. Again.</p><p>He turned to her instead. “What’s the mission?”</p><p>Ling Wen handed him a scroll. As he unfurled it, Feng Xin stepped in close to read over his shoulder, and Mu Qing twitched, surprised, then suppressed a shudder at the warmth of him pressed up against his arm.</p><p>“There has been an influx of prayers from the town of Guangshan in the last few months, and General Ming Guang has requested your help due to the…strange nature of the prayers,” Ling Wen said.</p><p>“Strange nature? What exactly does that mean?” asked Feng Xin.</p><p>Mu Qing had been skimming the scroll, and came to a section with several excerpts from the prayers. He read one of them aloud:</p><p>“‘General Ming Guang, please hear our prayer. For the past six days and nights, my husband and I have been unable to feel when we are touched: holding each other, hugging our children, a friend squeezing our shoulders — we can’t feel any of it. It cannot even be considered numbness, but simply — a complete lack of sensation. He is already beginning to grow frustrated, and I…am not sure if our marriage can survive this affliction. Please help us, General Ming Guang.’”</p><p>He frowned. The prayers only grew more desperate as he went down the page. “From these excerpts, it looks like it gets more severe over time — there’s several reports of worsening full-body pain after the first few weeks.”</p><p>“That sounds like some sort of disease, or maybe a curse?” Feng Xin speculated, eyebrows furrowed.</p><p>“Why ask for our help, then?” Mu Qing said. “It’s not like those are our specialties — what can we do that General Pei can’t?”</p><p>Ling Wen sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “General Ming Guang’s deputies have made several attempts to solve the issue, but they have been unable to do more than simply gather information.”</p><p>She picked up another scroll and held it out in their direction. Since Mu Qing still had the first scroll open in his hands, Feng Xin took it automatically and tucked it into his robes, still leaning heavily against Mu Qing, though he no longer seemed to be reading over his shoulder.</p><p>“That scroll has their detailed findings, but in summary, they were able to confirm three things,” Ling Wen said, returning to sit behind her desk. “First: it is most likely a curse. Second: everyone who was cursed had recently visited the Guangshan night market. Third: there is some sort of…entity…at the night market that is causing it. However, it is apparently extremely fast and cunning, and they were unable to discern its form, or even whether it is a beast, a demon, a ghost, or something else. Thus, your expertise in hunting is needed.”</p><p>After rummaging in the drawers of her desk for a moment, Ling Wen tossed something towards them. “You may also want to take this.”</p><p>Feng Xin caught it in one hand and showed it to Mu Qing — it was a jade talisman, covered in strange markings.</p><p>“Are we...supposed to know what this is for?” Feng Xin asked, his nose crinkled in confusion. It was unfairly cute; Mu Qing had to look away before he could be caught staring.</p><p>“Do you not recognize the handwriting?” Ling Wen sounded surprised. “It’s a token from Crimson Rain Sought Flower. As you know, he now has jurisdiction over the final fates of all ghosts that we capture. However, not all heavenly officials are willing to enter Ghost City to deliver them to his manor, so he’s given us these tokens. If you place one on a ghost’s body, it will bind to them and notify Crimson Rain Sought Flower of the ghost’s location, and he will come collect them.”</p><p>That…didn’t sound very much like Hua Cheng, honestly. Normally he would delight in forcing heavenly officials who were afraid of him to travel to Ghost City and enter his manor. Mu Qing figured the tokens were almost definitely Xie Lian’s idea.</p><p>Using a token was also completely unnecessary for the two of them — Feng Xin would absolutely want to use the ghost-escorting duty as an excuse to visit Xie Lian, if he happened to be in the city, and Mu Qing — well, he didn't have any objections to the idea.</p><p>Still. No need to seem too excited about the prospect.</p><p>“Tch. If Crimson Rain has time to come collect them, you’d think he could handle unruly ghosts himself, but of course he would have us do all the work for him.” Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “I see why this might be too much for his deputies to handle, but why exactly is General Pei not taking care of this himself?” he asked, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Ling Wen sighed, exasperated. “He is intent on having two gods assigned to this mission to ensure a greater probability of success, and he requested the pair of you specifically.” She muttered something that sounded suspiciously like ‘<em>and all of Heaven knows why.</em>’ “But he did offer to accompany one of you instead, if you’d prefer that, General Xuan Zhen.”</p><p>Mu Qing was about to scathingly decline, but Feng Xin beat him to it. “No! …I mean, that won’t be necessary. It’ll be easier for us to just go together. Right, Mu Qing?” He nudged Mu Qing with an elbow.</p><p>“Stop that, you’re getting dirt all over my robes,” Mu Qing complained, but he didn’t deny it. They did work well together, and it was infinitely preferable to being made to spend time with Pei Ming.</p><p>Forcibly, he shoved down the little voice in his head which declared with frightening certainty that spending time with Feng Xin was preferable to just about anything else, then rolled up the scroll he was holding and tucked it into his qiankun sleeve.</p><p>After a moment of hesitation, Mu Qing reached into the front of Feng Xin’s robes to grab the other scroll as well, snatched the jade token from Feng Xin’s hand, and put them both safely into his sleeve, tucked alongside the first scroll. Feng Xin smacked him halfheartedly, but didn’t put up a fight — all too aware that it was better for Mu Qing to hold onto any important items.</p><p>“Let’s just go. I assume we need to stop by your palace first since you came unprepared.” Mu Qing grabbed Feng Xin’s forearm and dragged him towards the door.</p><p>“Will you fucking shut up about that already! It’s at the night market anyway and it’s only afternoon, we’ve got plenty of time.”</p><p>“Time we could be using to investigate ahead of the night market opening!”</p><p>They left, still bickering all the way down the hall, and Ling Wen called after them, “Don’t forget to give an update in the reporting array once a day…” She winced as the door shut a little too hard on the way out, making the shelves on the wall rattle.</p><p>Martial gods…really.</p>

  <p>Mu Qing used the walk to Feng Xin’s chambers to read the second scroll Ling Wen had given them. It was a compilation of all the prayers as well as all the reports from Pei Ming’s deputies, but despite the volume of information, there really wasn’t anything particularly helpful that Ling Wen hadn’t already told them, and he sighed and tucked it back into his sleeve.</p><p>“Nothing useful,” he said, in response to Feng Xin’s questioning look. “It almost seems purposefully vague.”</p><p>“Pei Ming’s deputies could also just be bad at writing reports,” Feng Xin pointed out.</p><p>Mu Qing hummed, skeptical, but couldn’t quite focus on a counterargument when Feng Xin was walking so close to him.</p><p>It wasn’t just his imagination, either — there were quite a few surprised glances directed at the currently non-existent space between them as they walked, arms brushing with every step, even though Feng Xin’s deputies usually barely reacted to the sight of Mu Qing in their palace these days. </p><p>Mu Qing was also surprised, to be honest. This level of…touchiness…between them seemed to be a recent development, rapidly increasing in frequency since the events of Mount Tonglu.</p><p>It had been a few years since then, but it still caught Mu Qing off guard every time Feng Xin initiated casual physical contact. He felt hyper-aware of where Feng Xin was in relation to him at all times, trying and failing to prepare for the swooping sensation in his stomach that happened every time they touched.</p><p>It…wasn’t a <em>bad</em> feeling, necessarily, but Mu Qing couldn’t really tell if it was good, either — it was mostly just very, very overwhelming. It was hard to get used to being touched so softly and aimlessly after so many decades — centuries, even — without any kind of gentle contact he could recall.</p><p>Still, he didn’t want Feng Xin to stop. </p><p>In an effort to silently encourage him to keep doing it, Mu Qing did his best to suppress his automatic reactions of surprise, afraid that if he flinched away involuntarily Feng Xin would assume Mu Qing hated his touch; he also attempted to reciprocate at least occasionally, though he always ended up overthinking it and making things awkward — reaching into Feng Xin’s robes like that and then bodily dragging him away earlier probably came off much more aggressively than he’d intended.</p><p>At least Feng Xin hadn’t complained.</p><p>Soon they arrived at Feng Xin’s chambers in the heart of his palace, which were as chaotic as always. Mu Qing had to fold his arms and tuck his hands into his sleeves to resist the urge to straighten the room up a bit, especially when Feng Xin started swearing softly as he rustled through the various piles trying to find whatever set of robes he had in mind for their mission.</p><p>“Fuck, I could’ve sworn I put the clean ones here…” he grumbled.</p><p>“You know, there’s a very easy solution to this problem,” Mu Qing said conversationally. “You could — just as an example, I don’t know — actually <em>use</em> any of the multiple wardrobes and closets you have, instead of dumping all your clothes on every horizontal surface?”</p><p>“Well, sor-ry that cleaning isn’t exactly my highest fucking priority lately!” Feng Xin exclaimed. “Besides, it’s not like it bothers anyone.” A weird look came over his face. “If there was anyone else here regularly, I’d pay more attention to it, but it’s just me, and I don’t care if it’s messy, so…”</p><p>“You seem to be bothered about not being able to find things, though,” Mu Qing pointed out, very reasonably.</p><p>“Oh, shut the fuck up. Shouldn’t you just be happy that I don’t have my deputies do it for me? Mr. Everyone-Does-Their-Share-Of-Chores-At-My-Palace? …Ah-ha!” Feng Xin held up a handful of dark blue robes triumphantly. “Found them! See, it didn’t even take that long!”</p><p>“If that counts as not taking very long, I’m afraid to see how long you usually spend looking for thi—INGS?!”</p><p>Feng Xin had started stripping out of his training robes right in front of him, making Mu Qing’s voice hit an embarrassingly high pitch, and he whirled around with utmost haste to face the door.</p><p>“What the hell, can’t you warn a man first?!” he yelped, face turning red as he stared fixedly at the door.</p><p>Feng Xin laughed. “Come on, it’s not like you haven’t seen worse at the central hot springs! I can’t be that horrifying to look at, am I?”</p><p>…That was exactly the opposite of the problem, but of course Mu Qing couldn’t say that directly. “You don’t know that I’m not horrified,” he said weakly.</p><p>Feng Xin laughed again, and the sound of it only made Mu Qing’s blush grow hotter. “If you were truly disgusted, you’d just call me ugly directly, so I’ll take that as a win.” His voice sounded unbearably smug. “Alright, I’m dressed, so you can turn around and stop being such a prude now. I just need to fix my hair and then I’ll be good to go.”</p><p>Mu Qing turned around, and nearly went red again at the sight of Feng Xin in the dark blue robes. They were perhaps a bit fancy for a mission, but they did look…very good. He should really wear blue more often.</p><p>For a moment, Mu Qing considered offering to do Feng Xin’s hair — that was a sort of casual touch that friends did, right? </p><p>He’d always done Xie Lian’s hair because it was his job, but he did recall Xie Lian offering to do the same for him on several occasions, and having to confusedly turn him down, thinking it was just another instance of Xie Lian not quite recognizing that it was inappropriate for a prince to perform the duties of a servant — but now that Mu Qing knew Xie Lian had considered him a friend even back then, the gesture felt different.</p><p>Yes, this was something Mu Qing could do for Feng Xin, he decided. But by the time he’d thought it through and made up his mind to offer, Feng Xin had already tied his hair back into his signature topknot.</p><p>He bumped his shoulder against Mu Qing’s as he headed out the door. “You coming?”</p><p>Mu Qing had no choice but to follow, feeling strangely bereft.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>After casting a quick glamour to disguise their godly forms — it seemed like a bad idea to waste the energy to fully transform into Fu Yao and Nan Feng when they wouldn’t be in their own territory — Mu Qing and Feng Xin descended to the town of Guangshan, landing in a forest outside the town limits so as not to cause a disturbance.</p><p>The forest was quiet and peaceful, free of any strange energies — and of any people, for that matter — and they followed the path to the town in companionable silence without encountering anyone along the way.</p><p>Guangshan itself seemed to be small, but charming. The buildings were few in number, but well kept, and the streets were mostly quiet this far away from the night market, save for a few stray cats lingering in the last rays of sun of the day.</p><p>Feng Xin noticed Mu Qing looking at the cats, and elbowed him in the side. “You want to feed them, don’t you? Go on, then.”</p><p>Mu Qing spluttered. “I-I don’t! Just because I’m looking at them doesn’t mean I want to feed them!”</p><p>Honestly, if he were here alone, he would have already gone over to the cats, but it still felt weird to let himself do that kind of thing in front of anyone, even if it was just Feng Xin.</p><p>“Come on, there’s no need to be embarrassed,” Feng Xin said. “Here, if you don’t have anything to give them, take this.” He reached into his robes and took out a small pouch, removed a folded cloth from it, and opened it up on his palm to reveal some dried fish.</p><p>Mu Qing looked at him questioningly. “Why do you have this?” While he kept his own stash of treats in his qiankun sleeves, he hadn’t expected Feng Xin to be the type to carry much of anything with him — he’d usually bought supplies as needed on their past joint missions rather than bringing anything ahead of time.</p><p>Feng Xin shrugged. “No harm in keeping a little snack on hand for anyone who needs it. Sometimes the one who needs it is me!”</p><p>“…You like dried fish?” Mu Qing asked, surprised.</p><p>“It’s fine. Not one of my favorites, but it keeps well. I have some nuts too, but obviously I wouldn’t give those to cats. Just fucking take it, will you?”</p><p>He pushed his hand against Mu Qing’s chest, and Mu Qing finally took the fish from him, acutely aware of how their bare fingers brushed together for a moment.</p><p>The cats must have sensed that Mu Qing had something for them, because they trotted over before he had a chance to approach them, curling around his and Feng Xin’s ankles.</p><p>Softened by this unexpected discovery, Mu Qing made a split second decision and grabbed Feng Xin’s hand. Ignoring how Feng Xin’s eyes went wide in surprise, he put half the dried fish back into Feng Xin’s palm, said “You give them some too,” and swiftly knelt down so Feng Xin couldn’t see his expression — he was sure it was something unbearably sappy, and there was absolutely no need for Feng Xin to know how much his small acts of kindness affected Mu Qing.</p><p>“Alright.” There was a smile in Feng Xin’s voice as he knelt down beside Mu Qing, so close that their arms were touching. The cats swarmed around them, chirping excitedly, and Mu Qing thought he’d never felt so warm in his life.</p><p>After finishing up the dried fish, the cats stuck around for a few head pets and chin rubs before running off, and Mu Qing and Feng Xin stood up, brushing the dust off their robes and looking around.</p><p>“Shall we head to the night market? Or did you want to look around more first?” Feng Xin asked.</p><p>Mu Qing hummed. “There doesn’t appear to be much going on in the rest of the town at this time of day, so we might as well go directly there.”</p><p>The night market was easy to find, taking up a good part of the main street, and was surprisingly bustling even though the sun was still setting. Some of the vendors were still setting up their stalls, but there were a fair few who were already up and running, and the aroma of street foods both sweet and savory was beginning to fill the air. Groups were starting to congregate in some of the more open areas, and some of the vendors seemed to have brought their children, who played together behind the stalls where their parents could keep an eye on them — the buzz of conversation and children’s laughter gave the market an entirely different atmosphere than the calm and peaceful side streets.</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin wandered up and down the market, doing an initial sweep for anything suspicious, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary so far.</p><p>“We may need to wait until it’s dark,” Mu Qing said. “Let’s ask around and see if anyone has noticed anything strange, or heard about what’s been happening.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded. “Start with the vendors? I kind of want scallion pancakes.”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “Of course you do. I knew that would be the first stall you would notice.”</p><p>“What? You know as well as I do that they’ll be more likely to actually say something useful if we fucking buy something, so it’s two hawks with one arrow! <a href="#footnote1" name="return1" title="click to see footnote" rel="nofollow" id="return1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>”</p><p>“…Ugh. Fine,” Mu Qing sighed, though his reluctance was all for show — it was actually a nice change of pace that this mission was quiet enough so far that they were able to just…hang out like this. “But we’re getting tanghulu afterwards.”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>Feng Xin paid for their order, adding a little extra in hopes of enticing the vendor to talk with them, and Mu Qing divided up the scallion pancakes, giving Feng Xin the larger portion as usual.</p><p>While Feng Xin ate, Mu Qing addressed the stall owner. “Have you heard of anything strange happening in the area? We’re wandering cultivators looking for work.”</p><p>“Hmm…strange happenings…let me see…” </p><p>The vendor’s voice dropped, and he mumbled quietly to himself for long enough that Mu Qing thought he’d forgotten they were standing there. </p><p>“Ah! Yes!” he declared suddenly. “You see that area over there, that looks big enough for a stall but there’s nothing there?”</p><p>He pointed down the street, where there was indeed a spot that looked like a stall should be there. Strangely enough, people weren’t using the space to stand around and chat like they were with the other open areas of the market — they seemed to be avoiding the spot entirely. Mu Qing had assumed that they were saving the space for a vendor who had yet to arrive, but maybe there was more to it.</p><p>“I see it,” he said.</p><p>“That spot is bad luck,” the vendor said gravely, shaking his head. “I remember, I don’t know how many years back it was, it hasn’t been too long — but my grandson hadn’t been born yet, I know that for sure. Anyway — a while ago, there used to be a jewelry vendor who set up shop there, she’d been around for a while so everyone knew it was her spot, but one night, her stall was struck by a single bolt of lightning, just like that!” He held up his free hand and spread out his fingers, as if to indicate an explosion. “Everyone said the gods must have smited her, but at the time I thought, I don’t know, she did survive it after all.”</p><p>“Tch. What gods…” Mu Qing huffed into the private communication array he shared with Feng Xin.</p><p>“Right?” Feng Xin replied, sounding just as exasperated. “We don’t even have a Lightning Master right now, haven’t for what — 300 years?”</p><p>“332,” Mu Qing confirmed.</p><p>“Exactly! Sometimes lightning is just regular fucking lightning!”</p><p>Unaware of their conversation, the vendor continued, “But even though she survived, after a while I started to think those people must have been right. It didn’t take too long after that for her to lose so much business that she had to close up shop, and one day she just didn’t show up to the night market, and I never saw her again. If that isn’t the gods passing judgment, I don’t know what is! To this day, people say if you stand where her stall used to be, you could be struck by lightning too.”</p><p>The vendor poked his tongs in Mu Qing’s direction. “But I think something like that may be beyond the skill level of even strong young cultivators like yourselves. Best leave the gods to their own devices. You two be careful now.” He waved them off in clear dismissal.</p><p>Mu Qing saw that there was a line forming behind them, so he pulled Feng Xin off to the side and angrily bit into his scallion pancake. </p><p>“This is ridiculous,” he said into the communication array. “If the whole town is this superstitious we’ll hear a dozen stories like that before we find what we came here for.”</p><p>“We should still check it out,” Feng Xin said, resigned. “If we actually do get hit by lightning, it’s not like it’ll hurt us, and we’ll know if there actually is something really fucking weird going on.”</p><p>“…Fine,” Mu Qing huffed. “At least we know the glamours are working. He obviously didn’t suspect that we were gods at all.” </p><p>He finished his pancake, wiped his fingers clean with a handkerchief, offered the cloth to Feng Xin as well, and switched to speaking out loud. “But first, I was promised tanghulu.”</p><p>Feng Xin snorted, and affected a dramatic bow. “As you wish, my liege.”</p><p>They asked the tanghulu vendor if she’d heard of anything strange as well, but she just shrugged and handed them their order. </p><p>“Kids these days sure do love to ask if there’s been anything strange happening,” she said, and refused to elaborate.</p><p>The temptation to tell her he was her senior by more than eight centuries was strong, but Mu Qing resisted. Feng Xin did not have as much luck resisting his impulses — as soon as they were far enough away from her stall he burst into raucous laughter. </p><p>“<em>Kids these days</em>,” he wheezed, gripping Mu Qing’s shoulder to stay upright. “Oh, fuck, it really never gets old, hahahaha…”</p><p>As he often did when Feng Xin laughed, Mu Qing felt slightly dazed, and it took him a moment to shake off Feng Xin’s hand so he could eat the tanghulu without Feng Xin’s arm in the way. </p><p>“Dumbass,” he said. It came out a little too fondly. “Come on, let’s see if we can learn anything actually useful before we investigate where the jewelry stall used to be.”</p><p>“Come to think of it, we haven’t seen any signs of an…<em>entity</em>, or whatever the fuck Ling Wen called it,” Feng Xin mused as they walked. “Nothing in the forest to indicate any kind of spiritual beast, and the villagers definitely would have noticed if something like that came into the town.”</p><p>“We haven’t sensed any demonic energy, so it’s likely not a demon either,” Mu Qing said. “Unless they’re very powerful, and very well camouflaged. So —”</p><p>“Probably a ghost,” they said at the same time.</p><p>They turned to look at each other, and Feng Xin grinned at Mu Qing.</p><p>Mu Qing flushed, feeling blinded by the force of his smile. "What's that look for?"</p><p>“Nothing.” Feng Xin bumped their shoulders together. “I just like it when we’re on exactly the same page, that’s all.”</p><p>Embarrassingly, Mu Qing couldn’t say he disagreed. They’d always been able to read what the other was thinking when it came to battle, but being so in sync outside of combat was practically unheard of before Xie Lian ascended for the third time, and it had only become more frequent since Mount Tonglu. It was…surprisingly nice.</p><p>Mu Qing wasn’t anywhere near ready to admit how nice he found it out loud, though, so he just made a small noise of acknowledgement and kept eating his tanghulu.</p><p>They asked a few more people if anything strange had been going on in the area, and got no answers of any use whatsoever. Surprisingly, they hadn’t heard any other superstitious stories like the scallion pancake vendor had told them yet, so perhaps that was a better lead than they’d first assumed.</p><p>Once they’d finished eating, they headed over to the empty area where the jewelry vendor’s stall had once been. Up close, there was actually a faint outline on the street indicating where the stall had been — the stone there was darker than the stone on the rest of the street, charred either from the lightning or the fire it had likely caused, burning up the wood of the stall.</p><p>Mu Qing sent a stream of qi out to prod at the area. “No arrays, or anything spiritual at all,” he said after a moment. “It seems just the same as the rest of the street, just a little burnt.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded, and with no hesitation, he stepped directly onto the darkened area of the stone.</p><p>Mu Qing tensed, nearly snapping at him not to be so reckless, but when nothing happened after a few moments, he relaxed minutely. “Anything?” he asked.</p><p>“Not yet,” Feng Xin said. He shuffled around, testing different parts of the burned area, stepping out and back in, and even sitting down to see if that would change anything.</p><p>Nothing happened no matter what he did, and with a sigh he went back to stand next to Mu Qing. “I think it was a completely fucking normal lightning strike,” he concluded. “What now?”</p><p>“Ask the villagers about the curse directly?” Mu Qing suggested. “It doesn’t seem like we’re going to get anywhere without being more specific, since it’s after dark and nothing has happened yet, and we don’t have any other leads.”</p><p>It was generally bad form to reveal the extent of their knowledge about a mission to mortals, but Mu Qing really didn’t see a better course of action. They were both far too busy to camp out in the village for days or weeks on end, waiting for something to happen.</p><p>It turned out that no one was willing to admit to knowing about the curse either — though the villagers were certainly acting more suspiciously than when they’d asked about strange occurrences in general.</p><p>“I-I don’t know what you’re talking about! Haveagoodnight!” one said hurriedly, before nearly breaking into a sprint to get away from them.</p><p>Another said, “Don’t you boys know that talking about curses is bad luck? Shame on you, of course our little town hasn’t experienced anything so dreadful as that.” Her voice was steady but her expression looked like she was scared out of her wits.</p><p>“Fucking hell, they absolutely know what we’re talking about, they just won’t fucking tell us anything actually useful,” Feng Xin grumbled into the communication array, after they’d talked to several more villagers with the same results. “I don’t get it, usually people are happy when cultivators show up to help. How do they expect this to get fixed if they won’t fucking tell anyone about it?”</p><p>“They did pray to Pei Ming about it,” Mu Qing said. “…Surely they can’t be waiting for him to personally descend and, what, announce his arrival to the whole town? Even he wouldn’t be stupid enough to reveal his true identity to mortals.”</p><p>“Even if they were expecting him, isn’t it common fucking knowledge that ‘cultivators who are here to help’ might be gods in disguise? We could be Pei Ming for all they know — hell, we’re here on his behalf so it’s basically the same fucking thing!”</p><p>Their silent conversation was interrupted when Mu Qing felt a sudden tugging sensation on his sleeve. He looked down to see a small child who had grabbed two fistfuls of his robes.</p><p>“Um…gege?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“Yes, what is it?” Mu Qing kept his voice low so as not to spook her, and knelt down so he wasn’t looming over her. Feng Xin followed his lead and knelt down next to him.</p><p>“I-I heard gege asking about the no-touching curse…I don’t wanna get in trouble ‘cause we’re not supposed to talk about it, but…” She tugged at his robes again, seemingly trying to pull him in a certain direction.</p><p>“I think she wants us to go somewhere quieter,” Mu Qing said into the array.</p><p>Feng Xin nodded. “Good idea. Everyone is being so fucking weird about this curse.”</p><p>Out loud, Mu Qing said, “Alright little one <a href="#footnote2" name="return2" title="click to see footnote" rel="nofollow" id="return2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>, lead the way.”</p><p>They both stood up, and followed the little girl to a quieter side street just off the main road of the market.</p><p>She sat down on a set of stone steps, and pulled Mu Qing down to sit next to her, fiddling with the embroidery on his sleeve.</p><p>There was barely enough room for another person on the steps, but Feng Xin squeezed himself in anyway, squished between Mu Qing and the railing. He was so incredibly warm, especially against the cool night air, and Mu Qing had to force himself to focus on the mission instead of just letting himself melt against Feng Xin’s side.</p><p>“I like gege’s fancy designs,” the girl said, suddenly seeming shy.</p><p>“Thank you, I stitched them myself,” Mu Qing said. She gasped in awe, and Mu Qing kept talking before she could get too distracted by his robes. “What’s your name, little one?”</p><p>“I’m A-Li.”</p><p>“A-Li, do you think you could tell us what you know about the no-touching curse? We won’t tell anyone that you said anything, we just want to help.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded vigorously beside him, but kept quiet. Children tended to find him scary for some reason — maybe his perpetually scowling eyebrows? — so they’d long come to a silent agreement that Mu Qing should do most of the talking when it came to kids.</p><p>A-Li nodded. It seemed to take her a minute to gather up her courage to start talking, and Mu Qing waited patiently, letting her continue to play with his sleeve. “My — my parents both have the curse,” she whispered after a moment. “I think it’s because of that lady who got hit by lightning and died.”</p><p>“…Died? I thought she survived the lightning strike?”</p><p>“Yeah, but my mom said she died later. My mom also said ‘she was bad luck’, and ‘good riddance’, and all sorts of mean things about her, and right after that my mom got cursed and then my dad got cursed too and now they fight all the time,” A-Li said in a rush. “I-I think that lady didn’t like what my mom said about her and cursed them on purpose.”</p><p>“Sounds like the jewelry vendor might be our ghost, then,” Feng Xin said into the array.</p><p>Mu Qing hummed in agreement. To A-Li, he said, “Do you know of anyone else who has been affected by the curse?”</p><p>“S-some of my friends’ parents have it too. We’re not supposed to talk about it because everyone thinks if you talk about it you’ll get cursed too. But me and my friends talk about it and we’re not cursed so that’s just stupid. Do you want to know what me and my friends think?”</p><p>“What do you think?”</p><p>A-Li puffed out her chest proudly. “<em>We</em> think that that lady just doesn’t like people being mean to her or saying the gods hate her. She probably just wants to be left alone now that she’s dead but people won’t stop blaming her for things so she curses them.” Then more quietly, she said, “It’s not fair. It wasn’t her fault she got hit by lightning. It’s just not fair.”</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin looked at each other — this was by far the best lead they’d gotten yet.</p><p>“I think you and your friends may be right,” Mu Qing told her. “You’ve been very helpful, thank you for telling us all this. We’ll do our best to help.”</p><p>They stood up and walked A-Li back to the night market, where she ran back to a couple that were presumably her mother and father — they didn’t seem to have noticed that their daughter had disappeared for a bit.</p><p>“She ran right into their legs and they didn’t even flinch,” Feng Xin said quietly. “Definitely seems like they can’t feel it when they’re touched.”</p><p>Mu Qing nodded. Now that they’d seen the curse in action, it was easy to notice the signs of it all around them — people bumping into each other without reacting at all, others paying an unusual amount of attention to their feet as they were walking.</p><p>The only issue now was how to find the ghost. If A-Li was correct, maybe they could insult the jewelry vendor and see if she would show up to curse them?</p><p>Mu Qing was just about to suggest it when Feng Xin suddenly yelped next to him, “Hey, what the fuck was that?!”, and Mu Qing saw a blur of a shadow out of the corner of his eye, disappearing into an alley. </p><p>He instantly gave chase, sprinting down the alley until it opened up onto an empty courtyard. The shadow was nowhere to be seen, so he whirled around to face Feng Xin, who had followed him.</p><p>“What happened?” Mu Qing demanded.</p><p>Feng Xin frowned. “It just felt like something cold and wet touched my hand. Did you see what it was?”</p><p>“I saw…something,” Mu Qing admitted. “It was moving too fast to make out what it was, though. What, did a dog sniff you and then run off?” </p><p>Even as he said it, Mu Qing was sure that wasn’t right. There were some dogs wandering around the night market, so it wasn’t unreasonable, but they really should have heard if a dog approached them.</p><p>Although…</p><p>They’d barely started searching for the ghost, but…what if she had already found them?</p><p>To test his theory, Mu Qing reached out and put a hand on Feng Xin’s shoulder.</p><p>It took Feng Xin a second too long to react, looking at Mu Qing’s arm in confusion, and then his eyes went wide as he realized what had happened. “Fuck, I can’t feel that,” he hissed. “What the fuck, we weren’t even saying anything bad about her!”</p><p>Mu Qing held a hand ready to form the seal to materialize his saber. Taking a gamble that the ghost hadn’t left the area yet, he called, “We know you’re still there!”, and scanned the courtyard for any signs of movement.</p><p>Feng Xin picked up on his plan and moved to stand back-to-back with Mu Qing so they had eyes on the whole courtyard, his hands also ready to summon his bow and arrows. “We just want to talk. I swear that we won’t hurt you if you come out peacefully,” he said.</p><p>Nothing happened for several long moments, and then a high voice rang out, breathy as if carried on a gust of wind.</p><p>“No! I know what you are,” it hissed. “Haven’t you done enough? Stay away and leave me ALONE!”</p><p>On the last word, a burst of spiritual energy came hurtling towards them from a seemingly empty space on a nearby rooftop, and Mu Qing and Feng Xin had to jump away from each other to avoid it.</p><p>As he moved, Mu Qing could see — although just barely — the distortions in the air where the blast had come from, and he instinctively reached out to tap Feng Xin’s arm to draw his attention to it, only remembering at the last second that Feng Xin wouldn’t be able to feel it.</p><p>“The rooftop, third building from the left in front of me,” he barked into their array instead, and Feng Xin’s eyes lit up with recognition as he noticed the distortions too.</p><p>Feng Xin made a hand gesture that meant ‘flank her, I’ll keep her occupied’, and Mu Qing nodded, darting into another alleyway to make his way around to the back of the building.</p><p>As he ran, he could hear Feng Xin swearing up a storm, amplifying his usual loudness to keep the ghost distracted. “What the fuck, you’re the one attacking us?! And what in the hell do you mean, haven’t we — <em>fuck</em> — done enough?! …I’ve never — met you in my goddamn life!”</p><p>It sounded like the ghost had started attacking Feng Xin again, from the sounds of stone crumbling and how he kept pausing in the middle of sentences.</p><p>“’I know what you are’ — ha! What — exactly the fuck — do you think I am?! If you were thinking ‘a cultivator who gets pissed off when he’s attacked’, well, you — were fucking right!”</p><p>Mu Qing leaped onto the rooftop and saw that Feng Xin had drawn his bow, firing shots that deliberately missed to keep the ghost from leaving the rooftop. Quickly, he threw a spiritual binding rope to trap the ghost, but the distortions were hard enough to make out that he misjudged the distance, the rope only touching her instead of wrapping fully around her.</p><p>Then the ghost shrieked, coalescing into a more human form, and lunged at Mu Qing with inhuman speed, catching him off guard enough to plunge a wispy hand through his chest.</p><p>“FUCK, MU QING!” Feng Xin shouted in alarm.</p><p>The ghost hadn’t actually made physical contact with Mu Qing — her arm was nothing more than ghostly mist, not solid enough to touch him — but it did leave a cool, creeping numbness in his chest that slowly spread throughout his body, seizing up his muscles and making him fall to his knees.</p><p>Was this the cold and wet sensation Feng Xin had felt when the ghost had cursed him? It felt much more intense than he’d described, and Mu Qing shuddered, unsettled and unable to move.</p><p>Feng Xin was already running towards the building with a murderous expression, firing a barrage of arrows directly at the ghost now.</p><p>The ghost didn’t seem to realize that Mu Qing couldn’t move at the moment, acting as if she couldn’t retreat with him behind her, and she began to launch increasingly powerful spiritual blasts at Feng Xin, dissolving the arrows on contact. Feng Xin paid the energy blasts absolutely no mind, charging forward without even seeming to notice that they were coming close enough to singe his robes.</p><p>Mu Qing could feel the paralysis slowly wearing off, but it wasn’t enough to open his mouth to call out to Feng Xin, so he shouted in their array instead, “I’m fine, you moron! Focus on fucking dodging!”</p><p>It was obvious the instant Feng Xin heard him — he stopped in his tracks, eyes wide. “You’re fine? Then why aren’t you fucking moving?”</p><p>“JUST DODGE!”</p><p>Even though Feng Xin had stopped his barrage, the ghost hadn’t let up for an instant, and the moment of hesitation cost him dearly — an instant after Mu Qing had screamed into their array, the largest spiritual blast yet caught Feng Xin directly in the shoulder, and sent him flying across the courtyard.</p><p>Anger and panic surged up inside Mu Qing so strongly that his qi flared with a wild burst of power, instantly breaking the paralysis and briefly stunning the ghost in front of him. He threw the spiritual binding rope around her before she had a chance to react, and sprinted towards where Feng Xin had crashed into the courtyard wall.</p><p>Upon seeing that Feng Xin was mostly unharmed, Mu Qing sagged with relief. He was fully alert and gingerly pulling himself out of the crushed stone of the wall — his shoulder had a rather large, deep wound that was slowly oozing blood, but nowhere vital had been hit.</p><p>The wound would have likely killed a mortal, with how slow they were to heal, but since Feng Xin was a god, he’d be fully healed in less than a day — faster, if Mu Qing helped out, which he swiftly kneeled to do.</p><p>Mu Qing’s heart was still racing from the adrenaline. He put a hand on Feng Xin’s uninjured shoulder to keep him from trying to get up, and flinched when he couldn’t feel the touch at all. That cold, damp sensation that had paralyzed him was almost definitely the curse.</p><p>“Why the fuck are you so reckless,” he snapped, letting his other hand hover above Feng Xin’s injury to start sealing the wound with his qi. </p><p>“I’m sorry?! Who exactly was it that could have been fucking impaled by a fucking ghost arm just now??” Feng Xin said incredulously. “I don’t want to hear any goddamn lectures about being reckless from you!”</p><p>Mu Qing stayed quiet, refusing to acknowledge the outburst. He didn’t know how to explain that it was much more important for Feng Xin to be careful without sounding insane, or infatuated, or both.</p><p>After a long, tense moment of nothing but Mu Qing healing him in silence, Feng Xin sighed heavily, and his shoulders slumped. “You scared the shit out of me when you fell and just — stopped moving. What the fuck even happened back there?” He scanned Mu Qing up and down, as if making sure that he wasn’t lying about being uninjured.</p><p>“The ghost cursed me,” Mu Qing said simply. Before Feng Xin could object that the curse hadn’t paralyzed <em>him</em>, he continued, “I think it was more intense than it was for you because she put her entire arm through my chest. I could hardly even feel my own body at all until —” He cut himself off. </p><p><em>Until she hurt you and I kind of lost it.</em> </p><p>“—Until I finally snapped out of it.”</p><p>Feng Xin grimaced. “Fuck. I can’t believe we both got fucking cursed.”</p><p>“I can,” Mu Qing muttered under his breath.</p><p>Missions where they worked together tended to be…chaotic, to say the least. He’d even go so far as to say this one had gone better than most: even though they’d gotten cursed, they’d still captured the ghost in just a few hours with minimal property damage. Between efficiency and limiting destruction, it was usually one or the other with them, never both.</p><p>Speaking of the ghost — Mu Qing had nearly forgotten about her in his haste to check on Feng Xin.</p><p>He looked over his shoulder and saw that the ghost was thrashing around on the ground below the building she’d been on top of, presumably having fallen off while trying to escape the spiritual binding cables. The cables had suppressed her power enough by now that she had fully solidified into a slightly translucent human form, no longer able to hide herself from sight.</p><p>Feng Xin noticed the direction of his gaze. He looked down at Mu Qing’s hand still healing his shoulder, and tried to nudge it away — but unable to feel it when they made contact, he ended up sort of slapping Mu Qing’s arm away instead.</p><p>Mu Qing startled when his own arm moved without his input, whipping his head back around to glare at Feng Xin. “What the hell?”</p><p>“Sorry,” Feng Xin said, sheepish. “My shoulder’s fine for now though, we should go deal with the ghost.”</p><p>“Fine.” Mu Qing stood up, and pointedly did not offer a hand to Feng Xin to help him up. It would have been too awkward to pull him up when neither of them could feel the other’s grip, anyway.</p><p>Feng Xin stood up as well, dusting off his pants. “And…thanks. For healing me,” he said after a moment, hesitant but heart-wrenchingly sincere. “It already feels a thousand times better.”</p><p>Mu Qing froze in surprise, still unused to even the faintest of praise from Feng Xin. It wasn’t like he was never thanked — a decent chunk of the prayers he received were ones of gratitude — but something about it coming from Feng Xin, and with such sincerity too, made him momentarily speechless.</p><p>…Spending too much time with Feng Xin really was bad for his heart.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have to heal you if you’d be more fucking careful,” he snapped, and turned on his heel, marching off towards the ghost.</p><p>At his approach, the ghost stopped squirming so wildly, freezing up in fright.</p><p>“P-please don’t dissipate me,” she gasped as Mu Qing gripped the immortal binding cables at her back and hauled her upright. “I didn’t mean to hurt your friend, I just — none of this would have ever happened if you had just left me alone!”</p><p>“What do you mean, none of this would have ever happened? You were cursing people long before we got here — you can’t blame us for the consequences of your own actions.”</p><p>“Someone would have had to stop you eventually,” Feng Xin agreed, his voice very close by, and Mu Qing startled, unaware that Feng Xin had been standing so close to him. It was unsettling to not be able to physically feel his presence.</p><p>“I-I…” the ghost stuttered, and then fell silent, shaking with nerves.</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin exchanged a look. She was clearly too scared to talk to them.</p><p>“Maybe show her Crimson Rain’s token?” Feng Xin suggested in their array. “I don’t know if word has gotten around in the ghost realm that he has final jurisdiction now, but it’s worth a shot.”</p><p>Reaching into his qiankun sleeve, Mu Qing pulled out the jade talisman and showed it to the ghost. “Do you recognize this?”</p><p>Her eyes went wide. “Hua Chengzhu’s…? So he really is protecting us,” she breathed. Her shivers seemed to subside a bit. “…Fine. It’s not like I want to help the gods, but if you’re with him, then…” She sighed. “I guess there’s probably a reason you haven’t taken me to him yet.”</p><p>Feng Xin started next to him, and Mu Qing nearly elbowed him before remembering that it would have no effect.</p><p>“I know we’re not exactly ‘with’ Hua Cheng, but don’t tell her that yet,” Mu Qing hissed into the array instead. She would probably clam up instantly if they did.</p><p>“Calm down, I wasn’t fucking going to!” Feng Xin exclaimed. “She just said she didn’t want to help the gods — can she tell that we’re gods then? I thought glamours were supposed to work on ghosts as well as humans?”</p><p>Mu Qing frowned. “That is strange. Let’s try to get her to tell us how she knew, if we can.”</p><p>“We heard a bit of your story from some of the villagers,” Feng Xin said out loud, “but we’d like to get your perspective on things too.”</p><p>Mu Qing nodded. “We won’t harm you, and we’ll take you directly to Crimson Rain Sought Flower afterwards, so please tell us everything you know. The more information, the better.” He didn’t mention that outside of satisfying their own (mainly Mu Qing’s) curiosity, this was mostly so they could avoid submitting an incomplete report and incurring Ling Wen’s wrath.</p><p>“A-alright,” the ghost said. She thought for a moment. “Actually…I’m not quite sure where to start.”</p><p>“You could start with telling us your name, and how you knew we were gods,” Feng Xin said, jumping straight to the point. Mu Qing rolled his eyes — subtlety was definitely not Feng Xin’s strong suit.</p><p>“My name is Li Wanjie. And I-I didn’t know you were gods until I touched your hand. I confirmed it when I touched his chest,” she said, pointing to Mu Qing. “Both of you radiated power so intensely there was no way you could be regular cultivators.”</p><p>“What the fuck, she calls that ‘touching’ your chest?!” Feng Xin growled into the array. “Her fucking arm went right through you! If she was a little more solid you could have fucking died!”</p><p>Deprived of the option to try to calm Feng Xin down by leaning against his shoulder, Mu Qing just shook his head minutely. “Not the focus right now.”</p><p>Feng Xin scowled, but reluctantly dropped it.</p><p>Out loud, Mu Qing said, “You mentioned you didn’t want to help the gods. Why is that?” After a moment, he added, “This isn’t our territory, so don’t worry about offending us.”</p><p>“Oh sure, just throw Pei Ming under the carriage, why don’t you,” Feng Xin snorted, amused.</p><p>Li Wanjie looked down. “Do — do you know how I died?”</p><p>“Not exactly.”</p><p>“It was —” she shuddered. “Not a good death.” She took a deep breath, steeling herself to tell the story.</p><p>“When I was alive, I used to be a jeweler. I had a little shop I ran during the day, and a stall at the night market. One night, my stall was hit by a bolt of lightning — the stall burned down and the jewelry I had on display all melted, but at the time, I was just relieved no one was hurt. If anything, I felt blessed to have survived.</p><p>“Even though I didn’t have the resources to have a new stall built, I tried to keep selling at the night market with my wares laid out on the ground, but no one would come near. At first I thought it was because my display was too ugly without a proper stall, but then I started hearing whispers and rumors — that everyone thought the lightning was a message from the gods.</p><p>“Some of them thought the area where my stall had been was cursed, and that I’d invited bad luck upon myself by setting up shop there; others thought I was the source of the bad luck — that the gods hated me, and that association with me would bring calamity to them and their families. I started losing so much business that it was getting hard to make ends meet.</p><p>“And then —” Li Wanjie’s voice was a little wobbly. “And then I got sick. There were still a few people who didn’t believe the rumors — my friends and the man I was seeing — and they convinced the doctor to come see me. For a little bit, I was getting better, and then—” Her breath hitched on a sob, and she had to pause, her shoulders shaking. “S-sorry, I-I’ve…never told anyone this b-before.”</p><p>“Take your time,” Mu Qing said, not unkindly.</p><p>After a moment, Li Wanjie continued, still sniffling a bit. “And then…the doctor who was treating me s-suddenly died out of nowhere. I never found out what happened to him, but everyone was saying that he’d died because he touched me, because the gods had cursed me…and my—my f-friends believed it, even A-Fan believed it and I thought he l-loved me.”</p><p>Tears were streaming from her eyes now. “All of them — all of them abandoned me, everyone in the entire village refused to t-touch me or even come near me, because they thought they’d die like the doctor. I was already so sick I could barely move without help, and I just…just s-slowly died in my house, in so much pain I wished I could just end it instead of dragging it out for weeks.”</p><p>“That’s awful,” Feng Xin whispered.</p><p>“But even after I d-died, it still didn’t end. I didn’t have enough strength to leave this place for a long time, so I was forced to watch everyone here living out their happy little lives, without a care for what they put me through.” Li Wanjie huffed a single, wet laugh. “C-can you blame me for wanting them to suffer like I did?”</p><p>Mu Qing’s chest felt tight. Being hated for circumstances outside your control…it wasn’t something he’d wish on anyone.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Feng Xin murmured. He glanced at Mu Qing, a complicated look on his face, then turned back to Li Wanjie. “Would it help at all if the villagers did know what happened to you and their hand in causing it? We could — I don’t know, tell them your story somehow."</p><p>Ah. That look was probably him wondering if they even had the authority to offer something like that in Pei Ming’s territory. Even if they didn’t, Mu Qing thought Pei Ming would probably let them, considering the circumstances.</p><p>Li Wanjie made a noise of surprise. “You — you’d do that? I thought you were here to punish me.”</p><p>“Not so much <em>punish</em> you as make you stop cursing people, but yeah,” Feng Xin said.</p><p>Eyes wide, Li Wanjie slowly nodded. “A-alright. I — I think it would be good if you told them. Though…I don’t know that it will change anything,” she said, looking away. “Everyone’s already made up their minds about me.”</p><p>“If these people are so concerned with the opinions of the gods, I think we can find a way to make them listen,” Mu Qing said darkly. “If General Ming Guang allows it, I’d be willing to appear in their dreams until they kneel at your grave for forgiveness.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded seriously. “He <em>is</em> very good at scaring people in the dream realm.”</p><p>For some reason, this made Li Wanjie crack a half-smile. “R-really? I would have thought he was too pretty for that.”</p><p>“Trust me, those things are not mutually exclusive.”</p><p>Mu Qing froze for a second at the implication that Feng Xin agreed he was pretty — but quickly snapped out of it when something suddenly sent him stumbling to the side.</p><p>It was Feng Xin — apparently, he’d made as if to teasingly lean against Mu Qing, but, unable to feel when their shoulders connected, he’d used too much force and knocked them both off-balance.</p><p>“Oh, yeah. The fucking curse,” Feng Xin said, having evidently forgotten.</p><p>Mu Qing glared at him halfheartedly. “Speaking of the curse. Do you know how we can break it? Or will it wear off on its own?” he asked Li Wanjie.</p><p>Li Wanjie shook her head. “I — I’m not sure. I didn’t exactly intend for there to be an end date…but I’m not that powerful, so it will probably go away on its own. …I’m sorry, but I’m not a good enough person to break the curse for the villagers.”</p><p>“What about breaking the curse for us?” Feng Xin asked.</p><p>“Oh,” Li Wanjie said, surprised. “I’d…kind of forgotten that I’d cursed you both. You keep touching each other anyway, so it’s not very obvious…”</p><p>Mu Qing’s eyes widened. He’d only noticed the times their attempted touches went wrong — but he supposed the whole point of the curse was that he wouldn’t notice the ones that didn’t send him flying. The knowledge that the gentle touches were still happening often enough to make her forget they were cursed made a strange warmth rise up in his chest.</p><p>Feng Xin cleared his throat, his cheeks a bit red. “So…can you do it then?” he asked, not acknowledging her comment.</p><p>“…I can try? But I really don’t know much about curses. Please don’t get mad if it doesn’t work.”</p><p>Li Wanjie reached out towards Feng Xin, who flinched, but allowed her to touch the back of his hand. Her face scrunched up in deep concentration. After a few moments, she let go of him, and he automatically took a hasty step away from her and towards Mu Qing.</p><p>She gave him a strange look, but didn’t comment. “How about now? Did that remove it?”</p><p>Feng Xin held out his hand, and Mu Qing obligingly tapped the back of it.</p><p>“…Do it again? Since you can’t feel it either, maybe you didn’t tap hard enough.”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “Incredible. I think this is the first time you’ve accused me of being too gentle.” Still, he tapped the back of Feng Xin’s hand again, with more force this time.</p><p>Feng Xin frowned, then after a moment he yelled, “Ow, fuck! What the hell!” He shook out his hand like he was trying to restore circulation in it. “That was so fucking weird. I definitely didn’t feel it at the instant you hit me, but the pain still kicked in afterwards. It was kind of delayed?”</p><p>“Hmm. I suppose not being able to feel the initial blow doesn’t mean you can’t still get injured from it.” Mu Qing turned to the ghost. “It seems like that didn’t work. How can you know enough about curses to create one, but not know enough to break it?”</p><p>“I told you it might not work!” Li Wanjie looked away, a complicated expression on her face. “I don’t know. I think maybe…the curse sort of created itself, from the strength of my emotions? Like I said, I didn’t even know I <em>was</em> cursing them at first. I just wanted them to suffer like I did.” She sighed. “I tried to break it the same way it was created, but I don’t think…I don’t think I <em>want</em> to break it badly enough. I’m sorry.”</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin exchanged a glance.</p><p>“I get that you can’t let go of your resentment towards the other villagers, but we had nothing to do with what happened to you,” Feng Xin pointed out.  </p><p>“I — I know. It’s just…you’re still gods, you know? Logically, I know it wasn’t you, and I know you’re trying to help me. But I can’t help that when I think about the gods, I still feel so…so bitter, and angry, and abandoned.”</p><p>The edges of her ghost form seemed to shudder a bit, her energy a little less controlled for a moment before she solidified again. “I really am sorry. Maybe…maybe eventually I’ll move past it enough to be able to break the curse. But…I’m sure you’ll have fixed it on your own before then, anyway, with your cultivation as strong as it is.”</p><p>Li Wanjie looked down, not meeting their gazes.</p><p>There was silence for a moment as Mu Qing and Feng Xin conferred in their private array.</p><p>“I can’t say that I trust her,” Mu Qing said. Although he sympathized with her, this supposed inability to break the curse was a bit suspicious — it was relatively rare for ghosts not to be able to undo their own magic.</p><p>…Also, it was hard to ignore that she’d blasted a hole in Feng Xin’s shoulder. Mu Qing felt he’d already been exceedingly magnanimous to overlook that in his offer to appear in the villagers’ dreams.</p><p>“Yeah…it’s hard to say,” Feng Xin said, contemplative. “She seems like she’s telling the truth to me, but even if she isn’t, it’s not like we can force her to break the curse if she doesn’t want to.”</p><p>Technically, they could, if they handled her in the same way the heavens had traditionally dealt with malicious ghosts — but a curse that wasn’t even life-threatening was absolutely not worth risking Hua Cheng’s wrath over. Besides, even if they weren’t bound to the agreement with Crimson Rain Sought Flower, Mu Qing knew neither of them would be willing to disperse her now that they’d heard her story.</p><p>Mu Qing conceded with a shrug. “I suppose you’re right.”</p><p>He didn’t miss how Feng Xin’s eyes went wide. “It never ceases to surprise me when you agree with me,” Feng Xin said, shaking his head. “Should I let Pei Ming know we’re handing her off to Crimson Rain Sought Flower, then? I’ll ask him about your dream thing too.”</p><p>“Better you than me. I’d rather not deal with him if I don’t have to.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded, and went quiet in the array — presumably to call Pei Ming. In the meantime, Mu Qing walked over to an intact section of the courtyard wall and began drawing a teleportation array to take them to Ghost City.</p><p>Li Wanjie shuffled over to watch him. “Are you taking me to Hua Chengzhu now?” she asked quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Mu Qing said. “Once we leave you with him, let him know if you happen to think of anything that could help with the curse. I think that’s a fair exchange for our involvement in the villagers’ dreams.”</p><p>“Alright. …Thank you for that.”</p><p>After a bit, Feng Xin joined them by the wall, and Mu Qing glanced over his shoulder and saw that he was extremely flushed.</p><p>“What’s wrong with your face?”</p><p>It should have been impossible, but Feng Xin somehow went even redder. “Nothing! Shut the fuck up!” He crossed his arms, looking petulant. “Pei Ming is just a fucking menace, that’s all.”</p><p>“Nothing new, then.” Mu Qing completed the array with a small flourish, and dusted off his hands. “Shall we?”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded, and with a flash of light, they escorted the ghost through the array and into Ghost City.</p>

  <p>The attendants at Paradise Manor were used to the two generals by now, and admitted them to the palace without a fuss.</p><p>“Another one for Chengzhu?” one of them asked, gesturing at Li Wanjie.</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin nodded simultaneously.</p><p>The attendant stepped up to Li Wanjie, looking her up and down in appraisal, then nodded sharply. “Your hand, please?”</p><p>When Li Wanjie held out her hand, the attendant pressed two fingers to the back of it. “Just a little tracking spell so that Chengzhu can find you easily if you try to disappear before he decides what to do with you. Don’t worry, it’s not permanent.” She gestured at Mu Qing and Feng Xin. “You can release her from the immortal binding cables now.”</p><p>Mu Qing reached out, and the cables unwound at a touch of his hand. Interestingly, he could feel it when his fingers brushed against Li Wanjie — though it felt somewhat like dipping them into water, since she wasn’t fully solid. Maybe the curse only applied to living people? Not that it really mattered — he wasn’t exactly going around touching ghosts on a daily basis.</p><p>In fact, there wasn’t anyone he touched on a daily basis, besides Feng Xin, and even that was a recent development.</p><p>How long would it have taken for Mu Qing to notice he’d been cursed, if it had happened before Mount Tonglu and Feng Xin’s subsequent increasing clinginess? Weeks? Months? Probably not more than a year — he was pretty sure that even when their relationship was at its worst they’d still gotten into fistfights at least a couple times a year.</p><p>He tucked the binding cables back into his sleeve, and was about to ask the attendants if Xie Lian was currently at the palace, but Feng Xin beat him to it.</p><p>“Is Dianxia here?”</p><p>“Chengzhu and his husband are in the south wing at the moment. Do you need an escort?”</p><p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin both shook their heads, Feng Xin somewhat more fervently.</p><p>Some of the attendants at Paradise Manor tended to try to get handsy with him — whether Hua Cheng encouraged them to do so because he knew it made Feng Xin uncomfortable, or if they truly found him that irresistible, Mu Qing wasn’t sure, but he wouldn’t be surprised either way.</p><p>“We know where it is,” Mu Qing confirmed, and swept into the hallway before they could insist, Feng Xin following close behind.</p><p>When they arrived, the door was thankfully open, so there was little risk of intruding upon…<em>private activities</em>…and scarring themselves for life, but Mu Qing knocked loudly on the open door as they entered just in case.</p><p>Xie Lian’s head popped up over the back of an enormous, luxurious couch. Upon seeing them, his eyes went wide and he jumped up to greet them, setting down the book he’d been reading.</p><p>“Feng Xin! Mu Qing! What a surprise! What brings you here?” He rushed over, ignoring a small whiny “<em>Gege…</em>” from the direction of the couch and grabbing one of each of their hands to tug them over to the sitting area. “Come sit down, there’s tea, and I think we have snacks, too…”</p><p>They both looked down at where Xie Lian was gripping their hands, then at each other — with matching expressions of displeasure at the lack of sensation — before sitting down on the couch opposite Xie Lian.</p><p>Hua Cheng was stretched along the length of the other couch, and he immediately put his feet in Xie Lian’s lap the instant Xie Lian sat down again.</p><p>“We dropped off a ghost we captured on a mission, but…” Mu Qing trailed off, reluctant to admit they’d been cursed in front of Hua Cheng.</p><p>Feng Xin had no such reservations. “She fucking cursed us,” he finished with a scowl.</p><p>Hua Cheng snorted unpleasantly, and Xie Lian tilted his head, curious. “Oh?”</p><p>He poured them each a cup of tea, and they settled in to tell him about the events of the day.</p><p>When Mu Qing recounted how the ghost had blasted a hole in Feng Xin’s shoulder, he was surprised to notice that Hua Cheng’s grin of satisfaction at their misfortune faded almost imperceptibly — and even more surprised that it happened again when Feng Xin retaliated by making a fuss over Mu Qing’s false impalement (really, it wasn’t nearly as bad as Feng Xin was making it sound).</p><p>…There was no way Hua Cheng was actually concerned for their well-being. He was probably just disappointed the ghost hadn’t done more damage — or at best, annoyed that they were making Xie Lian worry over them.</p><p>“…And she really had no idea how to break the curse?” Xie Lian asked when they had finished.</p><p>Feng Xin shrugged. “That’s what she said, at least. I don’t think she was lying, though.”</p><p>Xie Lian hummed thoughtfully. “Have you tried all the usual methods already?”</p><p>“No,” Mu Qing admitted. “We came straight here after talking to her.” He felt around in his sleeves. “I don’t think I have any of the herbs on me, and I’d have to look up how to draw the arrays, but…I do have this.”</p><p>Mu Qing brandished a talisman triumphantly, then slapped it onto Feng Xin’s chest.</p><p>“Fuck, break my ribs, why don’t you,” Feng Xin complained.</p><p>The talisman flared briefly, then burnt up into fine ash.</p><p>“Well? Did it work?” Mu Qing demanded, automatically offering his hand to Feng Xin — even though they could’ve just as easily tested it by nudging shoulders, or something equally casual — and ignoring the knowing smirk from Hua Cheng’s direction.</p><p>Feng Xin didn’t seem to think anything of it, and he took Mu Qing's hand into his own. After a few seconds, his face fell. “Shit, no luck with the talisman.” He looked at Mu Qing, then at Xie Lian. “Should we try brute-forcing it, maybe? Just try to blast it out with qi?”</p><p>Xie Lian hummed. “I’m not sure…I’m not exactly a curse-breaking expert. San Lang, what do you think?”</p><p>Hua Cheng made a face, but surprisingly seemed to think the question through. “It could damage their meridians if the person doing the blasting doesn’t have excellent control of their qi, but it might work,” he said thoughtfully. “But I highly doubt either of gege’s friends are disciplined enough to maintain that kind of control themselves.” He looked at Feng Xin and Mu Qing. “Best leave it to the experts if you want your cores intact. I’m sure the medical gods would <em>love</em> to help out such upstanding martial gods as yourselves.”</p><p>Feng Xin shuddered, and Mu Qing suppressed a grimace.</p><p>Both of them tended to treat their own wounds, only occasionally going to each other for help and avoiding the medical ward at all costs — as a result, the medical gods did not think very highly of them, probably feeling snubbed. (As they should — Mu Qing was better at their jobs than they were, and healing wasn’t even his specialty.)</p><p>Xie Lian frowned, fully aware of his friends’ aversion to the heavenly doctors, and stroked one of Hua Cheng’s legs placatingly. “What if you do it for them, San Lang? I’m sure you’d do a much better job, anyway. San Lang is so skilled, and the medical gods are…well, let’s say that Feng Xin and Mu Qing don’t get along with them,” he said, as if Hua Cheng wasn’t already fully aware of that fact.</p><p>Hua Cheng made a considering noise, clearly reluctant but somewhat swayed by Xie Lian’s praise.</p><p>“I agree,” Feng Xin said, suddenly. He was looking down at where he and Mu Qing were apparently still holding hands, despite — or perhaps because of — not being able to feel it. “I think Crimson Rain would be the best person to do it. He broke Dianxia’s shackles, after all.”</p><p>Mu Qing looked at Feng Xin in shock, and Hua Cheng’s eyebrows flew up his forehead, his single eye going wide.</p><p>Only Xie Lian didn’t seem surprised — in fact, he was beaming in delight. “Ah, I’m glad you understand, Feng Xin! Mu Qing, what do you think?”</p><p>Mu Qing was speechless. “I — I…”</p><p>It would be one thing if it was only Xie Lian trusting Hua Cheng to do this, but if Feng Xin truly did too…? He supposed Hua Cheng wouldn’t actually kill them or irreparably hurt them, since that would make Xie Lian sad — and Feng Xin had a point that breaking a cursed shackle likely meant he had the skill to do it.</p><p>…Perhaps he was insane for it, but Mu Qing was willing to risk a little damage to his cultivation to be able to feel Feng Xin’s touch again. </p><p>“A-alright,” he said faintly.</p><p>Hua Cheng looked even more shocked for a split second, his eye darting between Mu Qing and Feng Xin, before he cleared his throat, expression quickly smoothing over. “Whatever gege wants,” he said softly, and sat up to place a kiss against Xie Lian’s temple. “Shall I try it right now?”</p><p>“I don’t see why not,” Xie Lian said. “If you two are alright with it?”</p><p>They nodded, and laid their wrists out over the table in between the two couches.</p><p>Still feeling a little dazed at what he had agreed to, Mu Qing startled at the feeling of Hua Cheng’s cold fingers against the inside of his wrist. Right — the curse didn’t apply to ghosts for some reason.</p><p>He was about to speak up and mention it, in case it was important somehow, but then Hua Cheng sent a rush of power into them, and he lost all ability to think.</p><p>It felt like he was freezing and burning up all at once, his meridians on the razor’s edge of splitting open under the overwhelming onslaught. It was actually quite painful, but somehow exhilarating — not dissimilar to the adrenaline rush after being injured in battle, but magnitudes more intense.</p><p>Then, as suddenly as it had started, it was over.</p><p>“Hmm,” Hua Cheng said. “I’m sorry, gege, I don’t think it worked.”</p><p>Feng Xin was the first to recover from the intense sensation, and reached for Mu Qing’s hand again.</p><p>“Fuck,” he said, when their fingers touched without any sensation. Then he touched Mu Qing’s wrist in the same spot where Hua Cheng had, and scowled when Mu Qing shook his head — still nothing. “Why is this curse so fucking persistent? How fucking powerful was that lady if even Crimson Rain can’t break it?!”</p><p>“It’s not really an issue of power,” Hua Cheng said. “Curses usually have a lot of intense emotions behind them, and they’re very strongly tied to the wishes of the ghost who cast them. I’m guessing she had an idea in her head of how it should be broken, however subconsciously, and anything other than that method won’t work. Simple as that.”</p><p>“She said she didn’t intend for the curse to be broken at all,” Mu Qing pointed out, feeling frazzled. “Surely that doesn’t mean it’s actually permanent.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s not permanent,” Xie Lian said soothingly. “We just need to keep trying — we’ll figure out how to break it eventually. Perhaps we could look into popular stories about curses in the region? See what kinds of ideas are common among the locals?”</p><p>“Good idea,” Feng Xin said. “Maybe they have a super fucking specific superstition about curse-breaking too. I’ll get some of my deputies on it.”</p><p>“San Lang and I will look as well,” Xie Lian assured. “For now, though — you two look a bit worse for wear. San Lang’s power is quite overwhelming, isn’t it? Do you want to rest in one of the rooms here, or are you okay to ascend?”</p><p>Hua Cheng had apparently lost whatever good will he had briefly had for them, because his glare clearly said, ‘I don’t care how tired you are, you will return to Heaven so I can be alone with gege. Or else.’</p><p>…Or perhaps Mu Qing was just losing it.</p><p>“We’re fine to ascend,” he said. Then he put a hand on Feng Xin’s arm, careful to ensure that they were actually touching, and whisked them both back to the heavenly capital in a flash of light.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>After arriving back at the Heavenly Capital, Mu Qing and Feng Xin headed back to their own palaces to try to get some rest. It was nearly midnight, and both were exhausted, more from Hua Cheng’s attempt at breaking the curse than the mission itself.</p><p>Only a few of Mu Qing’s deputies were still up and about, so he was able to slip past them and into his private chambers without them interrogating him on how the mission had gone — for some reason, they seemed extremely interested in his joint missions with Feng Xin lately. He barely managed to wash up and change into his sleeping robes before collapsing into bed with a groan, and falling asleep within minutes.</p><p>Mu Qing’s dreams weren’t quite nightmares, but they were strange and unsettling — soundless and filled with a creeping sense of isolation, time distorted in a way that made him more tired even while he was still asleep.</p><p>“Mu Qing!”</p><p>A voice calling his name cut through the silence of the dream, and he woke up abruptly — it was Feng Xin, sounding somewhat panicked in their private array.</p><p>“Feng Xin,” he called back, voice raspy with sleep.</p><p>Mu Qing thought he heard a soft <em>‘oh thank fuck’</em> in response.</p><p>“I’m on my way.” He tumbled out of bed, not even bothering to put on outer robes since their palaces were right next to each other — if he used the side doors he’d only be outside for a few moments anyway.</p><p>Besides, he’d taken this route to Feng Xin’s chambers in the middle of the night often enough that he could do it while still half-asleep.</p><p>The thought made him flush a bit.</p><p>It wasn’t as salacious as it seemed (no matter how much Mu Qing wished for it to be) — it was just that ever since Mount Tonglu, they’d gotten into the habit of helping each other recover from nightmares.</p><p>It had started when everyone was still in temporary lodging in the mortal realm, and they’d ended up sharing a tent. With only an arm’s length of space between their cots, such an arrangement made it impossible for either of them to hide their nightmares.</p><p>They’d ignored it at first when they woke each other up in the middle of the night, pretending nothing had happened to spare each other’s dignity — until one night, Mu Qing discovered that at least some of Feng Xin’s nightmares were about him: Feng Xin had awoken, bolting upright and screaming Mu Qing’s name.</p><p>At first, Mu Qing had thought his dream self had been hurting Feng Xin and stood up to leave, feeling vaguely ill and assuming Feng Xin wouldn’t want him nearby after such a dream — but before he could duck out of the tent, Feng Xin had leaped up and pulled him down into the most crushing hug Mu Qing had ever experienced, mumbling “You’re okay, thank fuck, it wasn’t real,” into his neck.</p><p>Shocked, Mu Qing could only sit there, Feng Xin’s grip on him slowly relaxing. It took him so long to process that him getting hurt was traumatic enough to be nightmare material for Feng Xin that by the time he’d snapped out of his daze, they’d gone fully horizontal and Feng Xin had fallen asleep on his chest.</p><p>It was the first of many nights spent holding each other after bad dreams.</p><p>Mu Qing wasn’t sure if Feng Xin knew that his own nightmares also often involved the other man getting injured, or worse, dying — if he’d ever called out for Feng Xin during those nights in the tent, Feng Xin had never mentioned it — but he did know that when he awoke from those nightmares, Feng Xin would sit next to him, shoulder-to-shoulder, and hand him a mug of tea, letting the warmth of his body sink into Mu Qing’s side while the tea warmed Mu Qing’s hands.</p><p>When the Heavenly Capital was rebuilt, they no longer shared a room at night, and though the nightmares had not stopped, Mu Qing had been determined to handle them on his own. He’d done it for 800 years before; he could do it again.</p><p>His resolve was quickly shattered the first time Feng Xin had called his private array in the middle of the night. “Why is your verbal password so fucking long,” he’d gasped, sounding on the edge of a breakdown. “And hard to say, what the fuck…”</p><p>The answer was, of course, to deter people from trying to talk to him privately — he’d absolutely set it to a long tongue-twister on purpose.</p><p>But Mu Qing had realized in that instant: he didn’t actually want to deter <em>Feng Xin</em> from talking to him.</p><p>He’d deflected the question at the time, and successfully distracted (or, more accurately, <em>bored</em>) Feng Xin back to sleep by reading out loud from one of the densest books he owned, but the very next day he’d gone to Ling Wen to ask about how she had set up a communal communication array that was always open.</p><p>While a normal communication array required the use of a decent amount of one’s own spiritual energy to keep the connection open, the public communication array ran on an enormous external power source that was constantly replenished, and only required a small amount of qi to use. Ling Wen hadn’t tried to adapt the public array for smaller groups before, so she’d had little in the way of advice, but she had kindly let Mu Qing read through her notes.</p><p>Mu Qing had left her palace with several sketches and a few ideas for altering the design so that it could fit onto a power source small enough that it could be easily kept in his room.</p><p>A few weeks later, he’d managed to obtain some spiritual stones to act as a power bank, as well as modify the array to consume less energy — he would still have to replenish the energy stores every few months or so, but otherwise, it appeared to work seamlessly.</p><p>Even after the array was ready, Mu Qing had had some difficulty working up the nerve to tell Feng Xin about it.</p><p>What could he even say if Feng Xin asked why he’d created it?</p><p>
  <em>‘Oh, you complained about it being too difficult to reach me once so I spent two weeks and a shitload of spiritual energy on making it so you can effortlessly call me at any time?’</em>
</p><p>No.</p><p>Absolutely not.</p><p>In fact, if Feng Xin ever found out how much effort Mu Qing put into this array, he might actually die of embarrassment.</p><p>Thankfully for Mu Qing, Feng Xin was not a particularly curious person. When Mu Qing finally did tell him, he hadn’t questioned Mu Qing’s motivations — he’d only reacted with excitement and inane suggestions.</p><p>“You know, you’d be drowning in merits if you took commissions for these,” he’d said, wiggling his eyebrows.</p><p>Mu Qing had rolled his eyes. “Never happening. If they want one they can make it themselves,” he’d replied. (He didn’t mention that he’d already prepared an extra array with one of the spare spiritual stones, set aside to be given to Xie Lian and Hua Cheng as an anniversary gift.)</p><p>Thus, they quickly got used to having a line of communication between them that was always open.</p><p>It was incredibly useful on missions, of course, but Mu Qing always felt the most grateful for the shared array when Feng Xin used it to call him in the middle of the night. While knowing about each other’s nightmares was unavoidable when they shared a tent, there was nothing forcing him to tell Mu Qing about them these days, so the fact that Feng Xin still willingly reached out to him for comfort made Mu Qing’s chest feel warm and tight.</p><p>Tonight, Mu Qing made it to Feng Xin’s chambers in record time, only slowing down right before he opened the door, and went in as calmly as if he’d walked the whole way.</p><p>Feng Xin was on the floor with his back against the side of the bed, his knees tucked up to his chin. He looked up at Mu Qing with damp eyes. “I really wish you hadn’t let her put her fucking arm through your chest,” he croaked.</p><p>Mu Qing sank down next to him. “Obviously I didn’t <em>let</em> her,” he said, somewhat offended. “I’m not an idiot, I would have dodged if I’d had time.”</p><p>He went to lean against Feng Xin’s side — and winced when he saw their arms make contact without feeling a thing.</p><p>Ah. He’d forgotten about the curse.</p><p>Looking down at where they were touching, Feng Xin’s face dropped even further. “Remind me again why we were so fucking nice to her when she fucking cursed us with this shit,” he growled.</p><p>Then, after a moment, he sighed and slumped down even further, the anger apparently having left as suddenly as it came. He looked Mu Qing up and down, eyes lingering on his messy hair and his chest where his sleeping robes had fallen open a little wider than usual in his haste to get to Feng Xin’s room.</p><p>Mu Qing thought he was about to poke fun at his disheveled state, but Feng Xin only said, “You are…actually here, right? This isn’t a dream?”</p><p>“I’m here,” Mu Qing said, rolling his eyes. “Where else would I be?”</p><p>Feng Xin huffed. “Guess I’ve gotten too used to — I don’t know, feeling your body heat to tell you’re really here and alive. It’s too fucking weird not being able to feel anything.”</p><p>Mu Qing hummed in consideration. If it was the body heat he was missing, then maybe —</p><p>He snatched a blanket from the bed and wrapped it around Feng Xin.</p><p>“Hey, what are you—?!”</p><p>Mu Qing tightened his grip on the blanket so it was squeezing Feng Xin’s shoulders. “Shut up. Can you feel that? The pressure?”</p><p>“Y-yeah?” Feng Xin said, confused. “But what—?”</p><p>Exasperated, Mu Qing shushed him again. “Will you just — <em>be quiet</em> and let me fucking concentrate! I’m too tired not to set your blanket on fire if I don’t focus!”</p><p>Once Feng Xin fell silent, Mu Qing closed his eyes and concentrated on heating up the blanket with his qi — just enough that it was warm, but not hot.</p><p>“Oh…” Feng Xin said softly after a moment. “That’s…Mu Qing…” He seemed like he wanted to say something else, but stopped himself, and tucked his face into the blanket where it bunched up near his neck instead.</p><p>Mu Qing looked away, his face flushing. This was almost more embarrassing than actually hugging Feng Xin — a real hug was significantly less effort than this blanket-and-qi facsimile of one, after all.</p><p>They sat in silence for a bit, Feng Xin burrowing more deeply into the blanket, and Mu Qing studiously avoiding eye contact under the guise of maintaining the pressure and temperature of the pseudo-hug.</p><p>“Two weeks,” Feng Xin said suddenly.</p><p>“…What?”</p><p>“If we don’t figure out how to break this goddamn curse in two weeks, I’m going to fucking find that ghost and <em>make</em> her break it,” he said, a determined expression on his face.</p><p>“I…I don’t think it works like that,” Mu Qing said, somewhat weakly. “Unless you’re planning on dissipating her.”</p><p>“If that’s what it fucking takes.”</p><p>Mu Qing knew he didn’t really mean that. Still, it was nice to know that he wasn’t the only one finding the curse upsetting. “We’ll break it before then,” he said, with a confidence he didn’t entirely feel.</p><p>“…I fucking hope so.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>After falling asleep on the floor of Feng Xin’s room, Mu Qing snuck back to his own palace the next morning while Feng Xin was still sleeping, determined to start the search for a cure to the curse.</p><p>Mu Qing spent the morning in his palace’s storeroom, gathering a small amount of all the plants and substances he had in storage that were known to have curse-breaking properties, then headed to the library to gather all the books on the subject they’d let him borrow. He was just finishing up when Feng Xin’s voice sounded in their array.</p><p>“You left,” he said, sounding put out. “Are you sick or something? You never wake up before me.”</p><p>Mu Qing huffed. “Some of us have things to do.”</p><p>It was true that of the two of them, Mu Qing was usually the one to wake up later — he’d never been a morning person, and now that he could set his own schedule he preferred to stay up late — but for some reason he’d woken up with the sun this morning and couldn’t get back to sleep, feeling too jittery and restless.</p><p>…It definitely had nothing to do with how he couldn’t feel Feng Xin’s warmth as he slept next to him.</p><p>“And what ‘things’ did you have to do so urgently? Don’t tell me you were that fucking eager to go back to delegating prayers.”</p><p>“Tch. Hardly.” Mu Qing looked down at the pile of books in his arms and decided it was easier to just show Feng Xin than list out everything he’d gathered. “Try to muster up the tiniest amount of patience and you’ll see,” he said dryly. “I’ll be back at your palace in an incense time.”</p><p>“So fucking rude for this early in the morning!” Feng Xin laughed. “Fine, see you in a bit.”</p><p>When Mu Qing arrived back at the palace, he found Feng Xin in his office, surrounded by piles of scrolls on all sides and reading in intense concentration.</p><p>“Hey,” Mu Qing said.</p><p>Feng Xin looked up. His eyes went wide upon seeing the stack of books Mu Qing was carrying.</p><p>“Hey,” he replied. “Guess we’ve been working on the same thing, huh?” He gestured to the mess of scrolls around him. “I’ve been going through my old mission reports to see if I’ve ever encountered a similar curse, or anything that would help with breaking it. Obviously I don’t remember anything from recently, but if it was fucking centuries ago…well, hopefully I would have written it down.”</p><p>Mu Qing grimaced.</p><p>He’d definitely gotten better in the last couple centuries, but the state of Feng Xin’s record-keeping back when they had first ascended had been…not good. He could recall multiple occasions when it had been Feng Xin’s turn to complete their joint mission report, and Mu Qing had had to do it himself anyway because Feng Xin had written nothing other than ‘Mission complete, no issues.’</p><p>From the deep frown on Feng Xin’s face, it seemed he was also suffering the consequences of his past self’s actions.</p><p>Making an executive decision, Mu Qing said, “Take a break from that for now and help me test if any of this has any effect on the curse.”</p><p>He began unloading the contents of his sleeves onto one of the unused desks in the office, taking out a mortar and pestle and countless vials, bottles, jars, and pouches, all containing the items he’d gathered from his storeroom, before sitting down at the desk.</p><p>Feng Xin looked equal parts relieved and apprehensive, eyeing the items on the table warily. “Are you sure you want my help? I seem to recall some pretty fucking colorful threats the last time I tried to go anywhere near your alchemy shit.”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “Obviously that’s because you were actively bleeding everywhere! You shouldn’t have been moving at all, let alone getting blood all over everything you touched!”</p><p>“Ah — haha,” Feng Xin laughed sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. “I’d forgotten about that part.”</p><p>It really should be illegal for his smile to be that bright.</p><p>“Of course you did,” Mu Qing muttered. “Anyway. You can start with the salves — just use some and I’ll try touching you to see if there’s a difference.”</p><p>“Alright,” Feng Xin said, sitting down next to Mu Qing and reaching for one of the jars. “Just put it wherever?”</p><p>It was actually a good question — many curses left a mark where the curse had been placed, which made it easy to know where to focus the curse-breaking efforts, but as far as Mu Qing could tell, he didn’t have a mark on his chest, nor anywhere else on his body. The back of Feng Xin’s hand had been free of any marks too.</p><p>As for Feng Xin’s body…</p><p>If Mu Qing thought about it for too long, he’d get wildly distracted by the idea of slowly stripping Feng Xin under the guise of checking for curse marks, so he hurriedly concluded that since Feng Xin hadn’t said anything about it, there must not be any traces of the curse hidden under Feng Xin’s clothes either.</p><p>“Hmm,” Mu Qing said, once he trusted his voice to come out steady. “Since there’s no curse mark, I assume it will only work on the area you apply it to, so just do the back of your hand or your arm or something. Somewhere easy for me to touch.”</p><p>Ducking his head to hide the heat he could feel creeping up his face at how his voice had cracked a little on that last sentence, he pretended to focus intently on the herbs he had begun grinding in the mortar and pestle.</p><p>All this frank discussion of touching each other was maybe starting to drive him a little crazy.</p><p>Between the two of them, it didn’t take very long to test all of the topical items Mu Qing had brought. Feng Xin methodically rubbed some of each salve onto the back of his hand, held it out within Mu Qing’s field of vision for him to tap, and wiped it off with a cloth and a burst of qi for good measure when it inevitably didn’t affect the curse at all — all while Mu Qing made several more salves from the raw ingredients he’d brought.</p><p>With every failed test, Feng Xin’s frustrated sighs grew in intensity, and the instant they finished testing all the topical solutions, he flopped onto his back beside Mu Qing with a groan, making Mu Qing wince when he nearly hit his head on the shelves behind them.</p><p>“Why is this so fucking difficult,” Feng Xin groaned. “She admitted herself she had no fucking idea what she was doing! Shouldn’t that make it easier to break than a curse from an experienced ghost?”</p><p>Mu Qing thought for a moment. “I think it’s actually the opposite.” He started packing away everything they’d tried already back into his sleeves. “Think of it like Xie Lian’s cooking. If he makes a soup, it’s almost impossible for someone to know what to change about it to make it edible, precisely because he has no idea what he’s doing. None of the usual tricks will work to fix it.</p><p>“Your soup, on the other hand,” he continued, pointing the pestle in Feng Xin’s direction, “is much easier to fix, because you at least have the basics down. You’re just not patient enough to taste-test as you go, so the seasoning is off, but it’s very simple to just add a little spice.”</p><p>Pausing, Mu Qing frowned, wondering if that had even made sense.</p><p>…Perhaps the metaphor had gotten a little away from him.</p><p>Feng Xin beamed up at him from where he still lay on the floor, seemingly having completely forgotten about his frustration. “Are you actually admitting you like my soup right now?” he crowed. “Holy fuck, I never thought I’d see the day!”</p><p>“‘Like’ is a strong word,” Mu Qing grumbled, the tips of his ears getting hot. “I’m saying it’s passable. Edible, at least.”</p><p>“That’s the same fucking thing coming from you!”</p><p>Feng Xin looked absolutely delighted, smiling so wide that the ever-present creases between his eyebrows had completely disappeared. That expression made Mu Qing want to kiss him so badly that he had to pinch his own forearm inside his sleeve to snap himself out of it.</p><p>“…A-anyway,” Mu Qing said, desperate to get the conversation back on track. “My point is that I think this curse is harder to break exactly because Li Wanjie had no familiarity with how curses normally work. The cure is probably going to end up being something completely ridiculous.”</p><p>“No matter how you try to change the subject, I won’t forget that you actually fucking complimented my cooking,” Feng Xin said, his voice unbearably smug. “It’s burned into my brain forever. Right here.” He tapped his own forehead.</p><p>Then he sat up with a sigh. “…But yeah, I guess that makes sense. Doesn’t make it any less fucking annoying though.” He looked at the desk where Mu Qing had left out two jars next to the stack of books from the library. “What else did you bring for us to try?”</p><p>Mu Qing gestured to the jars, “Those need to be made into tea instead of a salve. And the books are mainly on using arrays to break curses.”</p><p>“Urgh, medicinal tea is the worst,” Feng Xin complained, but dutifully stood up to find the tea set he kept in his office. “Fine, I’ll drink your disgusting tea and read for a while, as long as we can spar afterwards. Deal?”</p><p>“Deal.” </p><p>Mu Qing might be better at hiding it than Feng Xin, but he knew he was going to be restless too after sitting around for most of the day.</p><p>“…If you’re tired of reading your reports, I can take them and you take the books?” he offered after a moment.</p><p>Feng Xin waved him off. “Nah, I feel like if I read my own reports it might trigger a memory or something. It’s a long shot, but…”</p><p>He made a triumphant noise, having located the tea set, and brought it over along with a pitcher of water.</p><p>“Thanks though,” he said, sitting back down and eyeing Mu Qing with lighthearted suspicion. “You’re being awfully fucking nice to me today.”</p><p>“Hmph! I’m always this nice,” Mu Qing informed him with a raise of his chin. “You’re just unusually observant today, that’s all.”</p><p>Surprisingly, Feng Xin didn’t argue with him, or even reply at all. He just looked at Mu Qing intently, as if he was seriously considering his words, with one hand cupping the side of the teapot and glowing with qi to heat up the water.</p><p>A thought flashed in Mu Qing’s head, unbidden — he wished that hand was cupping his cheek instead.</p><p>Something about Feng Xin’s gaze pinned Mu Qing in place, making his stomach squirm and heat rise up his spine, feeling increasingly flustered and helpless to do anything but look back at Feng Xin. </p><p>After a long moment, Feng Xin finally looked away to pour them both a cup of tea, and the spell was broken.</p><p>Mu Qing slumped in relief.</p><p>He’d just collected himself enough to open up one of the books and begin reading when Feng Xin suddenly spoke up.</p><p>“You’re right.”</p><p>Mu Qing looked up at him in shock. “…What?”</p><p>“About being nice to me. You are,” Feng Xin said softly. “And not just today. …I —” He cut himself off, looking down, his face becoming increasingly flushed. “It’s—”</p><p>Suddenly, he seized the teacup in front of him, and downed the entirety of its contents in one go — then immediately turned fully red and began coughing up a storm.</p><p>“Augh, that’s — that’s fucking gross as hell,” Feng Xin spluttered. “Oh fuck, I should not have done that, fuck.” He dropped forward, letting his forehead thunk against the desk.</p><p>Mu Qing thought he could make out a muffled “My sinuses…” between the wet coughs.</p><p>Huffing a laugh, Mu Qing said, “So impulsive. No one said to drink the whole thing at once, idiot.” He thumped Feng Xin on the back, and shook his head when there was no reaction. “All that and it didn’t even work.”</p><p>Feng Xin groaned, and didn’t lift his head. “I’m dead. A martial god killed by a disgusting-ass tea. How fucking embarrassing.”</p><p>Mu Qing laughed again, barely avoiding inhaling his own tea. “What’s embarrassing is how dramatic you’re being. It’s really not that bad.”</p><p>He waited for Feng Xin to look up, and took a sip in demonstration — the tea wasn’t <em>good</em>, by any means, but Mu Qing had definitely tasted worse, and knew for a fact that Feng Xin had as well. </p><p>Keeping his expression from screwing up in distaste was shockingly easy when his mouth wanted to keep smiling at Feng Xin’s antics of its own accord.</p><p>Feng Xin was grinning now too. “Fine, fine, you win, I’m being a baby about it. Happy?”</p><p>“Very.”</p><p>At this admission, Mu Qing was feeling generous enough to only pour Feng Xin a small amount of the other tea they needed to test. It tasted slightly better than the first, but Feng Xin still made a face like he was on the verge of spitting it out — thankfully it didn’t send him into another coughing fit, but it also unfortunately had no effect on the curse.</p><p>There were no more teas to test after that, so they read their respective books and scrolls in companionable silence for a while, occasionally reading an interesting passage aloud to each other.</p><p>Hearing Feng Xin’s comments about missions from centuries ago made Mu Qing feel a strange sort of nostalgia. It was less ‘looking back on the good old days’ and more a sense of satisfaction at how far they’d come since the early days of their godhood.</p><p>The Mu Qing of back then — though already aware that all his feelings about Feng Xin, both positive and negative, were perhaps stronger than they should’ve been — would never have guessed that one day the two of them could sit together at the same desk like this, working together towards the same goal with only minimal bickering and no harsh words.</p><p>Past Mu Qing also would never have guessed that the goal they were working so desperately towards would be <em>to be able to touch each other again</em> — let alone that they’d been touching in a non-violent way to begin with.</p><p>Well…saying that it was only for each other wasn’t entirely accurate. Feng Xin touched people other than Mu Qing fairly often — initiating hugs with Xie Lian, clapping other gods on the shoulder, fixing his deputies’ posture as they trained — so he was really working to reclaim more than just the touches he shared with Mu Qing. </p><p>But for Mu Qing, contact with Feng Xin was really the only thing the curse had taken from him.</p><p>It was ridiculous that he’d easily survived centuries where the only time he touched Feng Xin was when they were fighting, but now, after only a day without it, he was feeling the loss of his touch so keenly it nearly hurt.</p><p>Feeling restless, Mu Qing slid a piece of paper into the book he was reading to mark his place, then snapped it shut.</p><p>The sound startled Feng Xin, and he made a surprised noise. “Spar?” he asked hopefully, setting down his own scroll.</p><p>Mu Qing nodded. He felt the weight of Feng Xin’s gaze as he stood and stretched, arching his spine until it popped satisfyingly, then shed the embroidered outer layers of his robes — it wouldn’t do to get them dirty or ripped during the fight.</p><p>Feng Xin seemed to be frozen for a moment, stock still and staring into the middle distance even as Mu Qing moved past him, but he soon leapt to his feet as well, and followed Mu Qing out to the training yard.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>The spar was…weird.</p><p>They started with training swords, thinking that using weapons would be the easiest way to avoid the curse tripping them up too much, but it didn’t take long before they disarmed each other out of habit, and fell into their usual routine of grappling and punches and kicks.</p><p>But it felt all wrong — their blows kept landing strangely, too hard or too soft, and when Feng Xin finally pinned Mu Qing, straddling him with his wrists held down above his head, Mu Qing couldn’t focus on anything except how he <em>couldn’t</em> feel Feng Xin’s weight and warmth pressing him down.</p><p>Rattled, he pushed at Feng Xin’s chest, and Feng Xin went willingly — albeit after a confused moment of looking down at Mu Qing’s hand — rolling off him to sit on the ground at Mu Qing’s side.</p><p>“Fuck. That…didn’t help at all,” Feng Xin said, after a few moments of them catching their breath.</p><p>“It really fucking didn’t,” Mu Qing agreed, pushing himself upright. “I think…I actually feel worse, somehow.”</p><p>Feng Xin frowned. “Worse how?”</p><p>Mu Qing didn’t quite know how to explain it. It felt like all the energy of the spar had built up inside him, trying to burst out of his skin, but with the odd lack of sensation it had nowhere to go and just rushed around inside him, scrambling his thoughts.</p><p>He was also hard, which was nothing new after a spar with Feng Xin, but it was somewhat surprising that it happened even without physical stimulation — and it did also make it even more difficult to attempt to say something coherent. </p><p>“I don’t know. Like I’m somehow even more restless, I guess.”</p><p>“Shit.” Feng Xin groaned in frustration. “Should we — if it’s making you feel worse, then — maybe we should…stop sparring until this is fixed?”</p><p>Mu Qing closed his eyes and sighed heavily. “…Probably.”</p><p>He could feel some deeper bruises than usual forming where Feng Xin had accidentally hit too hard, possibly even a broken rib. Even if his emotions weren’t running wild, it would probably be best to stop so they didn’t severely hurt each other — even when their relationship was at its worst they’d never left any injuries that took more than a day or two to heal, and Mu Qing wasn’t eager to break that streak now that they were actually friends.</p><p>…This was fine. Just another thing to feel an unreasonable sense of grief over losing, no big deal. It shouldn’t matter that sparring with Feng Xin had been the one constant for almost his entire fucking adult life.</p><p>Mu Qing let himself fall back into the dirt, squeezing his eyes even more tightly closed to ward off the highly unwelcome encroaching tears. He heard Feng Xin lay down next to him, robes rustling.</p><p>“Fuck. This really fucking sucks,” Feng Xin said, sounding almost as bitter as Mu Qing felt.</p><p>Mu Qing made a noise of agreement, afraid his voice would crack if he tried to say anything, and acutely aware that were it not for the curse, Feng Xin’s shoulder would be comfortingly pressed up against his own right now.</p><p>They lay there for a long time — so long that the sun was starting to set and one of Feng Xin’s deputies came looking for him, making a noise of surprise at finding both generals motionless in the dirt.</p><p>Reluctantly, Feng Xin left to take care of the palace matters he’d been neglecting all day, and Mu Qing went back to Feng Xin’s office to collect his outer robes, then back to his own palace to clean off the dirt and get some of his own work done.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>It turned out that neglecting one’s palace for a full day without delegating anything ahead of time made for rather a lot of catchup work, and both Mu Qing and Feng Xin ended up being too busy to meet again until the following day during a mandatory meeting for the Upper Court.</p><p>Even though the purpose of the meeting had nothing to do with the South,  Mu Qing would normally still be paying attention regardless, since he liked to stay informed on what was going on in the heavens — but today he was too distracted by the curse to be able to focus: Feng Xin sat next to him, as usual, but the lack of his warmth was glaringly obvious, leaving Mu Qing feeling unmoored. </p><p>When Feng Xin tried to bump their legs together to get Mu Qing’s attention, as he often did, Mu Qing was so lost in thought that he was caught completely off guard and nearly fell off his chair from how accidentally forceful Feng Xin had been, causing the whole room to stare at him in shock. </p><p>Fighting to keep his expression under control, Mu Qing waved off their questions and shot Ling Wen a glare for not immediately shutting down the chatter. </p><p>Though she was clearly unfeeling to his struggle, Ling Wen did have a vested interest in keeping the meeting moving, and after a few moments of watching Mu Qing squirm, she cleared her throat to pull everyone’s attention back to the meeting. Thankfully, everyone seemed to move on in fairly short order after that — they were so used to the southern generals disrupting meetings with their arguing that this was nothing in comparison.</p><p>Everyone moved on, that was, except for Pei Ming.</p><p>The ever-annoying god of the North watched them intently for the remainder of the meeting, and despite Mu Qing’s attempt to drag Feng Xin out the of the meeting hall quickly, Pei Ming even managed to corner them after it ended, blocking their path to the door with an infuriating grin on his face.</p><p>Ugh. Trying to get past him would cause even more of a stir, so it was best to just indulge him, at least until all the other gods had left.</p><p>Mu Qing sighed before reluctantly acknowledging Pei Ming.</p><p>“General Pei,” he said, voice tight, the <em>‘what are you doing here’</em> heavily implied.</p><p>“General Xuan Zhen, General Nan Yang. You two look even more sour than usual,” Pei Ming said, his expression altogether too cheerful. “Trouble in paradise? I hope you didn’t have a spat while helping me out down in Guangshan, did you?” He wiggled his eyebrows, not taking his eyes off Mu Qing.</p><p>“You know exactly what fucking happened, and you should be grateful it happened to us instead of you,” Feng Xin growled, with more venom than Mu Qing had expected.</p><p>Pei Ming blinked, looking properly chastised.</p><p>Mu Qing hadn’t been sure how much Feng Xin had told Pei Ming when he’d contacted him after they captured the ghost, but from Pei Ming’s expression and how his eyes darted to where their arms weren’t quite touching, Mu Qing figured he knew enough. It was indeed hard to imagine Pei Ming afflicted with this curse — for as much as it was affecting Mu Qing, the so-called god of love would probably suffer a hundred times more.</p><p>“Of course I’m very grateful,” Pei Ming said sincerely. “In fact, the entire reason I came over was to offer my assistance with the…<em>aftermath</em> of the mission. Anything you need, just ask.”</p><p>Mu Qing narrowed his eyes. “You’ve already transferred us the merits as payment. My deputies tell me you even overpaid as compensation for the curse. Why bother helping any further?”</p><p>Chuckling, Pei Ming crossed his arms and shook his head wryly. “So suspicious as always, Xuan Zhen. Can’t a person just do something out of the goodness of their heart?”</p><p>“No,” Mu Qing said bluntly.</p><p>“Aha, well, if you don’t believe me I suppose it can’t be helped.”</p><p>Feng Xin cut in before Mu Qing had a chance to respond. “If you know anything about how to break the curse, just fucking tell us already,” he said to Pei Ming.</p><p>Pei Ming looked at Feng Xin, then back at Mu Qing, seemingly trying to read something from their faces. Whatever he was looking for, he apparently found it, because he hummed, looking satisfied. “Hmm. I do have an idea, but I’m not sure if the good generals will like it.”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter whether we like it or not. Just tell us,” Mu Qing said, feeling impatient.</p><p>“Well, if you’re sure!” Pei Ming leaned in as if he was about to share a secret, even though all the other gods had long since left the meeting room. “So, you know how the curse makes it impossible to feel another person’s touch because the ghost herself was touch-starved and lacking in love and intimacy?”</p><p>…That wasn’t at all how Mu Qing would put it, but he supposed it was close enough — not worth arguing over.</p><p>He and Feng Xin nodded simultaneously, and Pei Ming continued. “Since the curse basically passes the ghost’s affliction on to you, I wonder if the cure is to do exactly the opposite of what was done to her.”</p><p>He wiggled his eyebrows again. Mu Qing had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>“That is, to shower each other with affection and touch absolutely every inch of each other’s—”</p><p>“THAT’S ENOUGH!” Feng Xin roared, leaping backward to put distance between himself and Pei Ming. His hand was extended awkwardly like he’d meant to drag Mu Qing with him, but missed, and his face was completely red with anger.</p><p>Pei Ming just laughed, unbothered by Feng Xin’s outburst. “Haha, I told you you wouldn’t like it! But give it some thought, now, eh? If you decide you want to give it a try, I have some items that might—”</p><p>“Holy fuck, will you fucking stop?!” Feng Xin exclaimed. “I should have known your suggestions would be lewd as all hell. Get the fuck out of here!” He gestured wildly in the direction of the door.</p><p>“Alright, going. Going!” Pei Ming said, and left, though not before throwing a wink and a cheerful wave at Mu Qing.</p><p>Mu Qing stood in shocked silence.</p><p>He wasn’t sure whether to be grateful that Feng Xin had saved them from hearing such garbage come out of Pei Ming’s mouth, or offended that the idea of touching Mu Qing like that was apparently so horrendous to Feng Xin that he couldn’t bear to even think about it.</p><p>Despite Mu Qing’s distaste for Pei Ming, the latter feeling was rapidly gaining ground the longer Feng Xin stayed quiet, and Mu Qing spun around to leave as well before the hurt could start to show on his face.</p><p>“Wait, Mu Qing—!” Feng Xin called, but Mu Qing was already out the door and booking it to his palace, intending to submerge himself in his palace’s hot springs for a while.</p><p>…Potentially for the rest of time.</p><p>The hot springs were thankfully empty when Mu Qing arrived, none of his deputies in sight. He didn’t even bother with removing his robes before leaping into the larger of the two cold pools and letting himself sink to the bottom.</p><p>Watching the sky become distant above him through the water’s surface, he felt the breakdown he’d been on the edge of receding as well, and his heart rate slowly calmed.</p><p>Staying underwater forever wouldn’t be so bad. He could probably give himself gills, spend some time with Black Water Sinking Ships — back when he’d been posing as Ming Yi, Mu Qing had gotten along with him better than most of the other heavenly officials, since he was quiet and calm and never indicated that he had anything against Mu Qing.</p><p>…Really, anything was better than this — this raging inferno of emotions Feng Xin ignited in him.</p><p>Mu Qing had never felt so out of control in his life. Why did it hurt so much that Feng Xin hated the idea of intimate contact with him? He’d always known that Feng Xin’s friendly touches were nothing more than that — just friendly, the same way he was with Xie Lian and everyone else — and that even those friendly touches were a miracle in themselves, given the history between them. But somewhere along the way, it seemed like Mu Qing had let himself start to hope that it could turn into something more.</p><p>Foolish. Foolish and pointless.</p><p>Now that he’d calmed down a bit, he could see that Pei Ming’s suggestion didn’t even make sense. If simply touching skin-to-skin removed the curse where they made contact, they would have known almost immediately — so even if touching was part of it (and it probably was, given Mu Qing’s luck), there had to be something more to it, something else they were missing. Until they figured out what that missing piece was, there was no sense in dwelling on Pei Ming’s words, or Feng Xin’s reaction.</p><p>Mu Qing pushed off the bottom of the pool and resurfaced with a gasp.</p><p>One step at a time.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Twelve days had passed, and they were rapidly approaching the end of Feng Xin’s self-imposed two-week deadline with no solution in sight. Pei Ming had popped up a few more times to ask if they’d given his idea any further consideration, which only succeeded in winding the tension in Mu Qing’s spine ever tighter. The lack of sparring on top of the constant awareness of the curse was driving him insane, and Pei Ming taking the whole situation so lightly was not helping in the least.</p><p>Both of them had spent so much time searching for a cure that work at their palaces was getting rather backed up, and there was finally a mission in Feng Xin’s territory that couldn’t be put off any longer without risking the lives of his worshippers. Mu Qing had offered to go with him, but Feng Xin had waved him off. </p><p>“You stay here and keep looking. No sense in both of us losing momentum.”</p><p>Mu Qing didn’t think there was much momentum to be lost, considering that they still hadn’t found even a hint to lead them in the right direction, but he was too mentally drained to argue about it, and he let Feng Xin go without a fuss.</p><p>It was weirdly quiet without Feng Xin around. </p><p>This had never bothered Mu Qing before, but apparently spending nearly two weeks with the man in constant close proximity had thrown him off-balance, making it hard to focus on the dense texts he’d borrowed from the library.</p><p>He was just thinking of spending some time sifting through his old mission records to see if they would inspire any ideas for curing the curse when Feng Xin suddenly called out to him in their private array, sounding strained.</p><p>“Mu Qing?”</p><p>He sat up straight, a strange feeling of dread trickling down his spine. “Feng Xin? What is it?”</p><p>“Can you — ugh…” A groan of pain came through the connection, and Mu Qing was on his feet and putting on his armor in the blink of an eye. “Can you come help? The reports said there was only one corrupted beast but of course there are fucking two.”</p><p>“Are you injured?”</p><p>“Just bruised,” Feng Xin said. “…Maybe a broken bone. And…fucking hell. Nearly out of spiritual energy. Fuck. When you get here you can’t let them touch you — I think the big one must have drained my qi when it grabbed me.”</p><p>Mu Qing was already sprinting out of his palace and jumping off the edge of the capital to descend into the mortal realm. “Grabbed you?! How did it get close enough — did you not bring a sword again?” he exclaimed, alarmed.</p><p>“Of course I brought a fucking sword!” Feng Xin insisted, sounding a bit out of breath. “It’s just — it kind of…stole it from me. Just — you’ll see when you get here, so hurry the fuck up!”</p><p>“Nearly there.” </p><p>Mu Qing landed in a valley close to where Feng Xin had said the corrupted beast had last been sighted. The rumble of its thundering footsteps as it presumably chased Feng Xin was difficult to miss, and he sprinted in the direction of the sound until Feng Xin suddenly appeared, nearly crashing into Mu Qing face first.</p><p>“Oh thank fuck,” Feng Xin panted when he caught sight of Mu Qing. </p><p>Mu Qing’s chest clenched at how rough he looked — he seemed worn out, pale and sweaty, and he was limping a little: hopefully the potential broken bone wasn’t his leg. </p><p>He wanted to check Feng Xin’s injuries more thoroughly, but before he had a chance to, the corrupted beast caught up to them. </p><p>Drawing up short at the sight of a second person, it snarled and began to pace, seemingly evaluating how much of a threat Mu Qing would be.</p><p>It was quite large, far taller than Mu Qing even on all fours, and it looked like it had once been a bear before the corruption took over and expanded its body, warping it nearly beyond recognition and giving it some distinctly un-bear-like features — a tail longer than its entire body with a dangerously sharp-looking tip, and thick, spongy scales all over its body. </p><p>The latter explained where Feng Xin’s sword had gone — Mu Qing could see it sticking out of the beast’s side, buried almost to the hilt and trapped by the scales. It was probably impossible to remove while the beast was still alive, since it was a regular sword rather than a spiritual one, and couldn’t be summoned like Mu Qing’s zhanmadao.</p><p>There were also countless arrows embedded in the scales, and even one in the beast’s eye, none of which seemed to faze it at all — it wasn’t even acting like it was in any pain.</p><p>Mu Qing quickly summoned his saber before the beast could get too close to them, brandishing it in front of him and maneuvering so that Feng Xin was protected behind him.</p><p>“Where’s the second one?”</p><p>“Not sure. It was chasing me with this one for a little bit, but it veered off somewhere before you got here.”</p><p>Mu Qing nodded in acknowledgement. “Stay behind me if you can. Don’t waste qi on spiritual arrows.”</p><p>Feng Xin made a noise of frustration. “No promises. If there’s a good opening it’d be fucking stupid to waste it. This thing’s only weak to qi, anyway — even my sword didn’t do much. Although…” He eyed Mu Qing’s zhanmadao. “You might have better luck with how massive that thing is.”</p><p>“Of course I will,” Mu Qing huffed.</p><p>Then he lunged toward the beast, catching it off guard enough to land a few hits, just enough to test how effective a regular attack would be against those scales. </p><p>It did cut deeper than Feng Xin’s sword, but not deep enough to give the beast any pause — the instant Mu Qing’s blade dislodged, it attacked relentlessly, swiping with a massive clawed paw and stabbing from above with its unnaturally long and sharp tail.</p><p>The dual assault didn’t leave Mu Qing any opening to strike again, and it took all his concentration to block both attacks while also keeping the fight away from Feng Xin and ensuring the beast was never able to touch him to leech away his qi.</p><p>When the beast finally did let up for a moment, Mu Qing was able to dart behind it, and he put all his physical and spiritual strength into the next attack, slashing at its leg while his qi thrummed through the zhanmadao and amplified its power. </p><p>This time, the blow cut clean through, and one of the beast’s hind legs was severed from its body.</p><p>Unfortunately, this only seemed to enrage the beast even further, and it screamed and attacked with renewed fervor. While its mobility was reduced as Mu Qing intended, making it easier to keep it away from Feng Xin, the swings of its paws and tail were so fast and powerful that just preventing it from touching him was starting to wear Mu Qing out.</p><p>…He probably should have tried to cut off the tail, first, huh.</p><p>Evading the frenzied attacks took up so much of his concentration that he didn’t even notice the second beast had returned until Feng Xin shouted:</p><p>“Mu Qing! On your left!”</p><p>Mu Qing dodged just in time. The second beast had nearly knocked him directly into the path of the first one’s attack. </p><p>It was significantly smaller than the first beast — a bit small for even a regular bear — and it moved much more quickly and quietly, though it seemed to have the same mutations, albeit with less spongy-looking scales: perhaps they had been a parent and child, before the corruption took over. Mu Qing almost felt bad for them, but there was unfortunately nothing left of the original bears in these creatures when the corruption was this advanced.</p><p>With both beasts now circling him, this battle was looking like it might be a close call.</p><p>Feng Xin could see it, too. “Will you yell at me if I provide cover fire <em>now</em>?” he shouted.</p><p>“Yes!” Mu Qing shouted back. “Unless you have normal arrows, save it until the situation is dire!”</p><p>“Is this not fucking dire right now?”</p><p>It was indeed dire, but Mu Qing was afraid of what would happen if Feng Xin completely exhausted his qi reserves and had nothing to protect himself with if Mu Qing couldn’t keep the beasts away from him.</p><p>Then again, if Mu Qing got hit and lost his qi too, they’d both be fucked, and the longer the battle dragged out, the more likely that was to happen.</p><p>Mu Qing groaned, conceding the point. “Can’t you just do that thing where you somehow make regular sticks work as arrows?” he yelled, dodging the attacks of both beasts.</p><p>“That uses qi too, dumbass!”</p><p>“It’s got to use less than forming entire arrows out of thin air, idiot!”</p><p>“Fuck! You’re right.”</p><p>Mu Qing would have collapsed from the shock of Feng Xin admitting he was right if that wouldn’t have immediately resulted in his death. “Of course I’m fucking right!”</p><p>There was no response for a moment, and then — five crooked ‘arrows’ embedded themselves into the chest of the smaller beast, and it fell to the ground in shock, its scales not quite thick enough to protect it.</p><p>Mu Qing immediately used the opening to move in and finish it off, ignoring the larger beast’s roar of rage as it geared up to attack him with even more fervor — it was moving slowly enough that he figured he should have enough time to deal the killing blow, and then dodge the stab of the larger beast’s tail and the swipe of its paw.</p><p>A final slash of his zhanmadao, and the smaller beast collapsed and crumbled into dust, the corruption dissolving away into thin air.</p><p>But before Mu Qing could move to dodge the tail, he heard Feng Xin yell, and then suddenly he was sent flying —</p><p>…Feng Xin had crashed into him from the side, knocking him out of the way.</p><p>The tail missed both of them, driving deep into the ground instead, and the beast lurched forward, thrown off balance. The swipe of its paw now aimed further forward than it had before the beast had lost its balance, and then — </p><p>…Then that paw caught Feng Xin squarely across the chest, tearing into him with its claws and launching his body across the clearing where he landed with a sickening thud.</p><p>A strangled scream tore from Mu Qing’s throat. “FENG XIN!”</p><p>Over the deafening sound of his blood rushing in his ears, Mu Qing thought he heard a weak “I’m fine” in response, but he couldn’t be sure it wasn’t just his own brain attempting to stave off the panic. </p><p>
  <em>Why did Feng Xin always fucking do this, getting hurt just to protect him?</em>
</p><p>He leapt to his feet and started sprinting towards where Feng Xin had been thrown. The beast was having none of it, though, and blocked his path, snarling and full of rage.</p><p>Little did it know that Mu Qing was rather snarling and full of rage himself.</p><p>He no longer had the presence of mind to hold back the spiritual energy in his attacks at all — the only thought in his head was that he had to get to Feng Xin as quickly as possible — and so every slash of his zhanmadao cut straight to the bone, tearing the beast’s scales to pieces and causing it to ooze out the thick essence of corruption that had replaced its blood.</p><p>Its neck was too thick for Mu Qing to easily behead it like he had done to the smaller beast, but the more he hacked away at it, the more it stumbled and missed its attacks, and finally, after what seemed like an interminably long time, it fell to the ground and didn’t get up, rather anticlimactically dissolving into dust without so much as a final rally of strength.</p><p>The instant Mu Qing saw it begin to dissipate, he was rushing to Feng Xin’s side.</p><p>As soon as Feng Xin came into sight, Mu Qing felt the tightness in his chest loosen a little — even though he looked awful, he was clearly alive and conscious, which was already better than what Mu Qing had been imagining.</p><p>The entire front of his robes was nearly destroyed, though, torn to pieces by three large gashes from the beast’s claws that crossed Feng Xin’s torso from shoulder to hip.</p><p>As Mu Qing dropped to his knees beside him, Feng Xin coughed out, “I said I’m fucking fine! It’s hardly even bleeding anymore.”</p><p>It was, in fact, still bleeding quite profusely. </p><p>The wounds were so deep that Mu Qing felt a little unsteady again, cursing himself for being so reckless with his qi in the final battle — he’d never handled an injury this severe when both he and the person he was healing were so low on spiritual energy.</p><p>But blind panic wouldn’t help them get through this, so he gave in to the instinct to convert that frantic energy into anger, and scoffed, grabbing the front of Feng Xin’s robes with both hands. </p><p>“You’re not fine, you’re a fucking idiot, that’s what. You’d think that after 800 years you’d have learned that archers are supposed to stay at a fucking <em>distance</em>.”</p><p>He punctuated the last word by ripping the robes open the rest of the way and impatiently pulling the remaining shreds away from Feng Xin’s chest to assess the damage.</p><p>Feng Xin made a strangled noise.</p><p>“What, were you attached to this outfit?” Mu Qing briefly eyed the tatters of the robes before laying a shaky hand on the least bloody part of Feng Xin’s chest and pushing qi into him, trying to stop the bleeding as quickly as possible. “Hmph. I’m not patching it up for you. Even if I wanted to, it’s far beyond salvaging, even for my talents.”</p><p>“That’s not —” Feng Xin protested weakly, and tried to sit up before gasping as Mu Qing’s qi inadvertently surged a little in frustration.</p><p>“Shut up! And don’t move!” Mu Qing snapped. “Fixing arteries is delicate work, I need you to be as still as possible.”</p><p>Feng Xin visibly forced himself to relax back against the ground, and something stirred in Mu Qing at how easily Feng Xin had followed his command.</p><p>“Good, like that,” he said before he could think better of it, and marveled at how Feng Xin’s face went a little red at the praise, despite the blood loss.</p><p>Interesting.</p><p>Once the most delicate part of the healing was done, Mu Qing added quietly, “You’re lucky <em>you’re</em> not beyond salvaging. I don’t know what the hell you were thinking, running in like that with no melee weapon and no fucking qi.”</p><p>“I was thinking you were about to get fucking impaled again, is what!” Feng Xin said hotly. “You can’t say you wouldn’t have been if I didn’t interfere. I don’t regret it and I’d fucking do it again.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t have been, because I had the timing planned out! Unlike you apparently! And how is trading one injury for another a sound tactic?!” Mu Qing demanded, unable to keep his voice from rising. “It was much more likely I’d survive a serious injury, I wasn’t drained of spiritual energy!”</p><p>“It’s exactly because I was nearly out of qi that it’s better it was me!”</p><p>“And how the fuck do you figure that?”</p><p>“If it was you I wouldn’t be able to heal you like this!” Feng Xin exclaimed, frustrated. “I don’t think I’d have had enough to even get us back to the fucking capital!”</p><p>...It was a good point, but Mu Qing wasn’t about to admit that.</p><p>“You still could have died,” he insisted stubbornly. “I’m not a miracle worker. If it had taken me any longer to kill it, you might have bled out.”</p><p>Feng Xin laughed, and then grimaced as the movement aggravated the wounds. </p><p>“We’re gods, Mu Qing. If that isn’t the definition of a fucking miracle worker, I don’t know what is.” He tipped his head back and closed his eyes. “I don’t know why you’re so upset about this, anyway. Pretty sure I’ve been hurt worse over the years.”</p><p>
  <em>And I’ve been upset every time…I just apparently used to be much better at hiding it.</em>
</p><p>Perhaps he’d lost his touch for maintaining his carefully cultivated aloof facade...or maybe he’d just been letting his guard down around Feng Xin lately. </p><p>His guard wasn’t so low that he could be honest about why he was upset, though, so he just scoffed and said nothing, hoping Feng Xin would drop it.</p><p>Once the internal damage was repaired, Mu Qing heaved a mental sigh of relief, then set to work on mending the skin so the wounds wouldn’t leave a scar.</p><p>Normally, scarring wouldn’t be an issue, since gods usually healed fast enough to avoid it, but since Feng Xin was so low on qi it was a definite possibility. There was no reason to risk it though, since preventing scars was Mu Qing’s specialty. The medical gods didn’t care nearly enough about aesthetics, in his opinion, so he’d had no choice but to learn how to do it better than they could.</p><p>He laid his fingers at the very edge of the uppermost gash in Feng Xin’s chest and began knitting the skin back together with his qi, slowly moving them along the length of the wound.</p><p>Feng Xin’s breath hitched, his breathing coming a little faster. “Mm, that feels nice,” he said, sounding a little dazed.</p><p>Then he suddenly tensed, his eyes flying open as he sat up. Mu Qing was too surprised to even scold him, having come to the same realization at the same time.</p><p>“Mu Qing, I can — I can feel that!” Feng Xin said, astonished. “How can I feel that? Are you using a special medicine or something?”</p><p>“No, nothing besides spiritual energy.” Mu Qing frowned. “Didn’t we do this already?” He’d already healed Feng Xin with his qi once since they’d been cursed, and it hadn’t had any effect — so why was it working now?</p><p>He moved his fingers against Feng Xin’s chest again, careful not to press too firmly on the still-tender skin, but Feng Xin still sucked in a harsh breath, and Mu Qing stopped the movement immediately.</p><p>“Still can’t gauge pressure very well,” he said in apology.</p><p>Feng Xin shook his head. “No, no, it didn’t hurt, it’s just...my skin feels super fucking sensitive...” He trailed off, his eyes going wide. “That’s it! Skin!”</p><p>Looking Mu Qing up and down, Feng Xin’s gaze narrowed in on Mu Qing’s arm. Before Mu Qing even had a chance to react, Feng Xin shoved up the sleeve of Mu Qing’s long robes and laid one hand against his bare forearm, the other hand coming up to cover Mu Qing’s own and press it against his chest.</p><p>“What — what are you doing?”</p><p>“Just wait,” Feng Xin said. His eyes bore into Mu Qing intensely, watching his face for a reaction.</p><p>It only took a few moments before Mu Qing felt it — first, the tentative touch of Feng Xin’s qi that always felt like sinking into a hot bath after a long day, its usual flood reduced to only a trickle now that his reserves were so depleted — and then — <em>then</em> — </p><p>…The soft warmth of Feng Xin’s hands against his skin.</p><p>The intensity of it was overwhelming, after so long without feeling anything at all, and Mu Qing had to focus to keep himself from trembling.</p><p>“Oh,” he breathed.</p><p>Sensitive, indeed.</p><p>“…Is it only where we’ve used qi with direct contact?” Mu Qing asked, once he could trust his voice to be steady. </p><p>To test it, he used the hand Feng Xin wasn’t holding against his chest to let some qi flow into Feng Xin’s arm where the robes still covered the skin, and tilted his head, silently asking Feng Xin if he could feel it.</p><p>Feng Xin shook his head — it didn’t work with cloth in the way.</p><p>Then Mu Qing hovered his hand over Feng Xin’s cheek, healing the bruising there without making contact with the skin, and then touched it as gently as he could.</p><p>“Seems like it, since I can’t feel that,” Feng Xin said, equally quiet. “Can’t fucking believe we didn’t try the combination of spiritual energy and skin-to-skin contact all this time.”</p><p>Mu Qing couldn’t believe it either.</p><p>Even though he’d healed Feng Xin before, it hadn’t been as serious of a wound, so he hadn’t touched him directly — and it was hardly like they had an occasion to exchange spiritual energy while touching outside of healing each other.</p><p>Still — he felt like an idiot for overlooking it as a possibility for the cure.</p><p>It did make sense, in retrospect. The ghost had been so convinced that cultivators would be able to cure the curse — of course spiritual energy would be required. And since she had been so touch-starved, it was no wonder skin-to-skin contact was part of the cure…as much as he hated to admit that Pei Ming had been right.  </p><p>The only thing that didn’t match up was that —</p><p>“…Hua Cheng did try it,” Mu Qing said faintly. “Is it just because he’s a ghost that it didn’t work?”</p><p>“Maybe?” Feng Xin shrugged, and finally let go of Mu Qing’s arm and hand. “Even if it had worked for him, I can’t say I would have been fucking enthused about him touching anything more than our wrists, so it hardly would have helped anyway.”</p><p>Mu Qing resisted the urge to grab Feng Xin’s hands and put them back, already missing their warmth. </p><p>“<em>Our</em> wrists?” he asked with a raised eyebrow. “You have an opinion on where Hua Cheng touches me, do you?”</p><p>Feng Xin’s cheeks went a little pink again, and he looked away. “No! O-of course not. But I know you do! You hardly ever let anyone touch you except for…never mind. Just — just fucking finish healing me already,” he grumbled.</p><p>Now Mu Qing was the one blushing. He hadn’t realized that Feng Xin had noticed he was the exception to — well, to <em>all</em> of Mu Qing’s rules. How embarrassing.</p><p>Opting to ignore that part of the conversation entirely, he refocused on mending Feng Xin’s wounds and said, “The curse didn’t seem to apply to ghosts in the first place — I could feel it when both Li Wanjie and Hua Cheng touched me. I wonder if that’s why they couldn’t break it.”</p><p>“Hmm…maybe,” Feng Xin said, sounding distracted. Perhaps the pain was getting to be too much, or the sensation of the healing was too overwhelming now that he could feel where Mu Qing’s hands were sealing up the wounds.</p><p>It took a while, but finally Feng Xin’s chest was fully healed, and Mu Qing thankfully had enough spiritual energy left over to take them back to the heavenly capital.</p><p>Mu Qing had meant to offer Feng Xin some of his qi once they were back if he still had extra to spare, but the moment they arrived in front of their palaces, Feng Xin rushed inside with a hasty <em>‘goodnight’</em> before Mu Qing could say a word, his face still flushed and slightly unsteady on his feet.</p><p>Baffled, Mu Qing shuffled into his own palace. For once, he was too tired to question Feng Xin’s behavior, and upon making it to his bed, he promptly passed out without thinking any further about it.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>The following day, Mu Qing’s deputies refused to let him handle even the simplest of prayers to distract himself. Every time he thought he’d be able to sneakily pilfer a scroll from one of the tables in the common area, one of them would suddenly appear next to him and snatch it right back.</p><p>They didn’t scold him, but they did give him piercing looks of such patent disapproval that he eventually had no choice but to give up and retreat to his chambers.</p><p>Forced into resting and recovering, Mu Qing was cooped up all day with too much time to think, and the more he thought about it, the more he was convinced that the qi and physical touch solution was entirely too simple. There had to be a catch of some kind — maybe it was only a temporary fix?</p><p>He was itching to test if the curse was still gone from where Feng Xin had touched him yesterday, but the last time he’d checked in on Feng Xin, he was still sleeping, so Mu Qing restrained himself, pacing inside his chambers instead, since his deputies would glare at him if he paced in the hallways while he was still ‘recovering’.</p><p>Speaking of his deputies…</p><p>There was no rule that Feng Xin had to be the one to test it, was there? Mu Qing just so strongly preferred it to be him that he’d never thought of enlisting his deputies before, but now, Feng Xin could be asleep for possibly days before he would be fully recovered, and Mu Qing refused to wake him over something as trivial as being restless over this stupid curse.</p><p>Sighing, Mu Qing entered the Xuan Zhen palace array and called his head deputy to his chambers.</p><p>“General,” Yang Jinghui said when he arrived at Mu Qing’s door. “You’re not resting.”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “I’m recovered, I don’t need to rest anymore.” Truly, a man overworks while his limbs are still healing from burns <em>one time</em> and his deputies will hover for the rest of his immortal life. “This will be quick, anyway. Just touch the back of my hand.”</p><p>He held out the hand that Feng Xin had covered with his own yesterday.</p><p>Yang Jinghui looked at it, perplexed. “…Touch your hand? Are you sure?”</p><p>Was it really that strange of a request? “Yes, I’m sure.”</p><p>The head deputy shrugged, and laid a single finger on the back on Mu Qing’s hand.</p><p>Mu Qing felt…</p><p>…Nothing.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” he said emphatically. Then he remembered that Yang Jinghui was still there and winced.</p><p>Apparently, the cursing was less of a shock than Mu Qing requesting to be touched, because Yang Jinghui seemed completely unfazed. “Was that all, General?”</p><p>“Ah. Yes. You may go.”</p><p>As soon as the door closed behind his head deputy, Mu Qing sank to the floor by his bed. How exactly was he supposed to try to be less pessimistic when he kept being proven right that everything good had a catch?</p><p>It had been about a day since Feng Xin had removed the curse from his hand, and the last time he’d confirmed that the curse was still gone was about two shichen after it had been removed, when Mu Qing offered his hand to Feng Xin to help him up before they headed back to heaven.</p><p>So — the cure lasted more than two shichen but less than a day.</p><p>Fuck. Removing it on such a frequent basis was completely unsustainable. Feng Xin would surely get sick of touching him every day if it came to that, and Mu Qing wasn’t willing to have anyone else do it, so…</p><p>There <em>had</em> to be a way to make the cure last longer than that. At this point he was nearly willing to ask <em>Pei Ming</em> for advice if it would get them closer to a permanent solution.</p><p>Wait…Pei Ming.</p><p>Pei Ming had said that if the cure involved touching each other, he had some ‘items’ that might help, didn’t he? Mu Qing had assumed he was just being crass at the time, but what if he did actually have something that would be useful?</p><p>…Oh gods, Mu Qing was really going to ask Pei Ming for help, wasn’t he.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>Knowing it needed to be done did not make it any easier for Mu Qing to swallow his pride and call Pei Ming.</p><p>“Ah, General Xuan Zhen! To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p><p>“General Pei,” Mu Qing grit out. “Regarding your…suggestion from the other day. You mentioned you had ‘items’ that may help?”</p><p>He closed his eyes, bracing for the gloating and teasing that was sure to come — but to his surprise, Pei Ming only hummed thoughtfully.</p><p>“Oh, so you’ve finally decided to try it? You do seem to have excellent timing, General.”</p><p>“Excellent…timing?”</p><p>“Yes, I was actually going to contact you soon, but you just happened to reach out first! Funny, how that works.” Pei Ming chuckled. “I just heard from one of my worshippers who was afflicted with the curse a few shichen ago — she said she’s been cured for about a week! Do you want to know what she told me?”</p><p>Ugh, it was so hard to actually admit out loud that he needed Pei Ming’s help. Still, at least it was over the array where Pei Ming couldn’t see his expression, and it was far better than having to deal with his teasing in person. </p><p>“…Yes,” Mu Qing admitted with great difficulty. “What did she say?”</p><p>“Apparently, the trick is to remove the curse from the entire body all in one go! I trust you know how to remove it since you’re here asking me about my theory, but it seems if you leave any skin left untouched, the curse will just spread again from that spot and you’ll be back where you started. So—” Mu Qing could practically hear the lascivious smirk in his voice, “—you’ll need to be very <em>thorough</em> with your exploration of each other’s bodies.”</p><p>Mu Qing groaned out loud, careful not to transmit it through the array. Pei Ming was so fucking annoying, but Mu Qing would not give him the satisfaction of knowing he was bothered if he could help it.</p><p>“I see,” he said, tone carefully neutral.</p><p>Pei Ming laughed again. “No reaction from the stoic Xuan Zhen, I see! So cold!”</p><p>“You know me. Always cold,” Mu Qing said flatly. “And the items you mentioned?”</p><p>“Ahhh yes,” Pei Ming said, a grin audible in his voice. “I certainly have a variety depending on your…<em>needs</em>, but I’m guessing the only one you’ll accept from me will be the bath salts.”</p><p>Studiously ignoring the implications of the rest of the sentence, Mu Qing asked, “Bath salts?”</p><p>“Another thing my worshippers told me about recently! If you bathe with them, they will make it possible to see a normally invisible curse on your skin! Quite perfect for your situation, I would think. Mortals really are amazing sometimes, aren’t they?”</p><p>If Pei Ming had told them about this before, Mu Qing would have scoffed that it was completely unnecessary since they already knew that the curse affected the whole body, but now that he knew that there was a time limit to fully clear the curse before it would just spread again…</p><p>“That sounds…not entirely useless,” he admitted reluctantly.</p><p>“Ahh, faint praise from General Xuan Zhen,” Pei Ming said, irritatingly cheerful. “It’s no wonder General Nan Yang chases this feeling.”</p><p>Mu Qing flushed. He couldn’t even refute that, his mind stuck on replaying the way Feng Xin had reacted to the lightest of praise while Mu Qing was healing him.</p><p>Oblivious to his mental sputtering, Pei Ming continued, “Anyway. I’ve got places to be, but if you want to pick up some of those bath salts, you can drop by my palace any time. They’ll be on me, as compensation for you going through all this trouble. Sound good?”</p><p>“…Fine. We’ll be in touch.” He left Pei Ming’s array before the other general could say anything in return, and slumped down further so that he was nearly laying on the floor.</p><p>He’d felt fully recovered earlier, but after talking to Pei Ming he was exhausted again. A quick check in with Feng Xin’s palace revealed that he was still asleep as well, so Mu Qing gave into the temptation to just go back to bed.</p><p>At least his deputies would be pleased with him for actually trying to rest.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>The next day, during the weekly mandatory meeting, Mu Qing finally got to see Feng Xin for the first time since the incident.</p><p>Feng Xin had shown up late, so he hadn’t been able to sit next to Mu Qing as usual, but Mu Qing didn’t mind, since it meant he got to scrutinize him more easily. It felt a little nostalgic to sneak glances at Feng Xin like he used to, back when the other gods would force them to stay at opposite ends of the room during meetings lest they start a fight and destroy all the furniture.</p><p>He looked much improved now compared to the last time Mu Qing had seen him. His color was better and he seemed back to his regular energy levels; the only thing off was that his hair was haphazardly spilling out of its usual neat bun, like he’d put it up in a hurry after realizing he was late to the meeting.</p><p>It didn’t look bad — quite the opposite, in fact — but for some reason, Mu Qing was still itching to fix it. It really shouldn’t be allowed for just anyone to see him all disheveled like this.</p><p>Halfway through the meeting, Feng Xin finally seemed to notice Mu Qing staring at him, and a small smile appeared on his lips — Mu Qing looked away quickly, trying to keep his traitorous face under control.</p><p>Uncaring of Mu Qing’s struggles, Feng Xin reached out in their private array.</p><p>“Mu Qing, hey.” The smile was audible in his voice, and Mu Qing couldn’t resist looking at him again to watch it grow bigger on his lips. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“How am <em>I</em> feeling?!” Mu Qing only barely avoided making a scandalized noise out loud. “I’m not the one who nearly got slashed to pieces! How are <em>you</em> feeling!”</p><p>“Practically as good as new, thanks to you,” Feng Xin said. “But don’t think I didn’t notice you dodging the fucking question. I know you weren’t resting as much as you should have been.”</p><p>Mu Qing was probably never going to get used to how strange it felt to hear Feng Xin actually thank him for things. “Ugh. I’m fine.” Then, after a moment, “Wait, what do you mean you <em>know</em> I wasn’t resting?”</p><p>“Uh, because it doesn’t fucking count as actually sleeping if you’re burning spiritual energy going into other people’s dreams?”</p><p>…What the hell?</p><p>Mu Qing was too shocked to even reply for a moment. “You think I’ve had time for criticizing my followers’ art lately?!” he hissed into the array. “I’m — I know you think little of me but even you can’t possibly think I’m vain enough to waste time and energy on that right now!”</p><p>“What?” Feng Xin sounded genuinely confused, his eyebrows furrowed as he looked at Mu Qing searchingly from across the table. “Wait, I wasn’t talking about your followers — you — you’re saying that you didn’t visit my dreams while I was recovering, then?”</p><p>Mu Qing stared at Feng Xin from across the table, his eyes wide. “I didn’t.”</p><p>For a long moment, neither of them broke eye contact, both frozen while they processed the meaning of this. Then, Feng Xin ducked his head, his cheeks going red.</p><p>“Well, fuck me,” he said in their array, the embarrassment clear in his voice. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to…accuse you, or whatever. It just felt so real I assumed it was actually you.”</p><p>“…It’s fine,” Mu Qing said, somewhat distracted. His mind spun trying to think of what could have possibly happened in the dream to convince Feng Xin it was really him. The easiest explanation was that he’d fought with Feng Xin, but…it made something sink in Mu Qing’s chest to imagine that even in Feng Xin’s dreams they couldn’t get a break from fighting each other.</p><p>Feng Xin must have noticed something in his voice or expression, because he hurriedly said, “And it wasn’t a nightmare, or anything bad at all, so don’t get twisted up thinking about that!”</p><p>Suddenly, a loud clearing of the throat brought their attention back to the meeting. Ling Wen had noticed their distraction, and she shot each of them a dirty look before continuing on with the meeting. </p><p>Mu Qing grimaced at Feng Xin, and Feng Xin shrugged, in mutual agreement that they could talk more later.</p><p><br />
</p><hr /><p><br />
</p><p>After the meeting, Feng Xin walked with Mu Qing back to his palace, uncharacteristically quiet. He seemed lost in thought about something, and Mu Qing had to shout at him twice to stop him from walking off the path face-first into the shrubbery.</p><p>For his part, Mu Qing also couldn’t stop thinking about the implications of Feng Xin dreaming about him so intensely that he’d believed Mu Qing was really there. </p><p>Especially since it had apparently even been a good dream! Or at least not a bad one.</p><p>Once they arrived in Mu Qing’s office, Mu Qing closed the doors and slapped a silencing talisman on them to ward off the nosy deputies he’d spotted trailing them in the hallways. (Perhaps he’d been indulging their information-gathering tendencies a little too much.)</p><p>Then he crossed his arms and pinned Feng Xin with a piercing look. “Tell me what happened in your dream,” he demanded, no longer able to contain his curiosity.</p><p>“Ah, nothing too crazy,” Feng Xin said, looking embarrassed. “We sparred a little, and uh…discussed the curse.”</p><p>“We sparred?”</p><p>“Yeah. It was…it was fun. I thought you’d gotten tired of waiting to spar in real life, so you decided to do it in our dreams to see if the curse wouldn’t apply there.”</p><p>To Feng Xin’s credit, Mu Qing was in fact very tired of not being able to spar in real life, and testing if the curse still worked in dreams did seem like something he would do.</p><p>“And? Did it still apply?”</p><p>“No, it seemed to be gone, but — since it wasn’t actually you, I don’t think that means much.”</p><p>That made sense — normally, people appearing in dreams were a part of the dreamer’s own mind. The curse didn’t apply to touching your own body, so why would it prevent you from touching the figments of your own imagination?</p><p>Now that the possibility was raised, Mu Qing was wildly curious as to whether the curse would have still applied to him if he’d really gone into Feng Xin’s dreams himself — he was almost tempted to suggest they test it out, but with the real cure in sight it would be stupid to waste a night on it when they could just be actually breaking the curse instead.</p><p>Though — there was something else he was curious about. </p><p>“Who won?”</p><p>“W-what?” Feng Xin flushed a little. “What does that fucking matter! It wasn’t actually you fighting me,” he grumbled, not meeting Mu Qing’s eyes.</p><p>Mu Qing smirked. “I’m just curious who your subconscious mind decided was stronger, that’s all.”</p><p>Feng Xin grit his teeth. “It’s — it really wasn’t a normal… Fuck. Fine. You won, okay? Happy?”</p><p>His smirk grew wider. “Very.”</p><p>Even if Mu Qing couldn’t manage it himself these days, at least his dream self in Feng Xin’s mind could avoid getting distracted by Feng Xin’s…<em>everything</em>…and keep it together long enough to win a spar.</p><p>“Well. Good, then.” Feng Xin rubbed the back of his neck. “Speaking of the curse, I meant to tell you…I think something changed about it for me. When I woke up, my legs and my right arm started feeling all fucking tingly, like when you were healing me, and I figured I should just…test it.”</p><p>Tentatively, Feng Xin reached out to touch Mu Qing’s shoulder with his right hand, and gasped softly when they made contact. “Fuck, I think it’s really fading,” he said in wonder. Then he moved even closer to Mu Qing, putting both his hands on Mu Qing’s shoulders. </p><p>Mu Qing shuddered from the proximity, even though he couldn’t feel the touch himself.</p><p>“Is it just your left hand that’s still cursed?” Mu Qing asked, trying to keep his voice steady.</p><p>“That’s what I’m trying to figure out.” Bracing himself against Mu Qing’s shoulders, Feng Xin lifted one leg at a time and gently bumped his foot, then his knee, then his thigh against Mu Qing’s legs. “Seems like I can feel all of both legs and my right hand,” he said. “Can you — is it alright if I —”</p><p>Mu Qing nodded automatically before Feng Xin could even finish the sentence, and Feng Xin immediately wrapped his arms around him in a hug.</p><p>Before he could even react, Feng Xin stepped back again — the hug was over so quickly that Mu Qing didn’t even have time to mourn not being able to feel Feng Xin’s arms around him. Still, it threw Mu Qing off enough that it took him a moment to realize that it hadn’t just been a random hug — Feng Xin had been testing the exact boundaries of where the curse had faded.</p><p>Sure enough, Feng Xin drew a line up from his left hip to his right shoulder with a finger, and then indicated everything on the upper left side of the line. “Everything from here up is still numb,” he said. “I guess the curse must have radiated outward from where she touched me?”</p><p>The ghost had touched Feng Xin’s left hand to curse him, so it made sense that the curse was strongest in the area closest to that hand.</p><p>Unfortunately, it also made sense that Feng Xin’s curse was so much lighter than Mu Qing’s that it had already started to fade, while Mu Qing’s was just as strong as ever. The ghost had given Mu Qing much more than a brief touch, after all — he still remembered how intense and unsettling it was to be fully paralyzed by her power, however briefly.</p><p>“What about you?” Feng Xin asked. “Is it fading at all for you yet?”</p><p>Mu Qing shook his head. “Not at all. The opposite, in fact — even after you removed it from my hand and arm it was back after less than a day.” He sighed heavily. “The cure doesn’t last for very long if we do it piecemeal, apparently.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes went wide. Then he took Mu Qing’s hand and laid it against his own chest over one of the spots where Mu Qing had healed him the other day. “Oh fuck, you’re right,” he breathed. “Most of where you removed it is numb again.”</p><p>Even though Mu Qing couldn’t feel it, the visual of Feng Xin pressing his hand against his chest was making Mu Qing feel hot, and he had to yank his hand away so he could think clearly again.</p><p>Feng Xin made a small noise and his arm twitched like he wanted to take Mu Qing’s hand again, but he didn’t. Instead, he sank onto the nearby couch-bed with a sigh. “What should we do, then? If the cure lasts less than one fucking day…”</p><p>Mu Qing decided to make tea before joining him — it would give him an excellent excuse to avoid eye-contact for this conversation.</p><p>“There is a way around it, at least,” he said, pouring water into the teapot and heating it with a bit of qi. “I talked to Pei Ming. Apparently we — we do have to…touch each other everywhere. Since the curse affects the whole body.”</p><p>Mu Qing was tempted to sneak a look at Feng Xin’s expression, despite the risk of exposing how flustered he was getting just talking about this, but he resisted the urge. “Apparently, it spreads again from anywhere that’s still cursed, so we have to remove it…all in one go. Preferably in the span of only a few shichen.”</p><p>“He figured that out himself, did he?” The skepticism in Feng Xin’s voice was evident. “…Or —” he said after a moment, his voice hardening with anger,  “— did he know the real cure this entire fucking time and was just playing coy about it? I’ll beat his ass into the ground if he was hiding it from us.”</p><p>“No, he said one of his worshippers figured it out,” Mu Qing said. It felt strange to defend Pei Ming. Mu Qing could hardly believe he was about to say this, but — “He seemed sincere enough. If annoying as always.”</p><p>Feng Xin snorted. “Ah, that makes more fucking sense. Mortals are always more creative than we give them credit for.”</p><p>Mu Qing poured two cups of tea and handed one to Feng Xin before sitting down next to him on the couch-bed.</p><p>“Removing it all in one go is hardly any different from what we were going to do, though, right?” Feng Xin said contemplatively, after taking a sip from his cup. “I mean, we were already pretty sure about the touching part. I didn’t imagine we’d be stopping partway through anyway, barring some kind of emergency.”</p><p>Mu Qing hardly expected to <em>want</em> to stop, himself, but it only seemed prudent to be prepared for things to go wrong — if they had a fight, or if Feng Xin hated touching Mu Qing or being touched by him, or if Mu Qing got so turned on that Feng Xin figured out it was more than just a natural physical reaction to being touched…</p><p>If any of that happened and they had to stop, it could be worse than if they’d never tried at all, with no permanent progress on the curse-breaking front to offset the inevitable emotional wreckage.</p><p>Or at least, no permanent progress for Mu Qing. But for Feng Xin…</p><p>Feng Xin…didn’t really need the cure anymore, did he? The curse was fading so quickly for him that it had halfway disappeared while he was sleeping. He could just…he could just wait it out a few more days and not have to deal with Mu Qing at all.</p><p>Noticing that Mu Qing had blanched, Feng Xin reached out and put a hand on Mu Qing’s arm. “Hey, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Mu Qing stared down at the hand, as if he’d somehow be able to feel its touch if he just glared at it for long enough. “Why…why are you doing this,” he hissed, trying and failing to keep his voice steady.</p><p>“Mu Qing? What do you —?”</p><p>“Why are you here, talking about breaking the curse with me like you aren’t going to just let it disappear on its own? Why act like we’re in the same situation here when — when —”</p><p>
  <em>When you don’t need me to fix this for you at all, but I need your help more than ever?</em>
</p><p>Mu Qing cut himself off before that thought could escape, gripping the edge of the couch-bed so hard that his fingers lost all their color.</p><p>“Mu Qing. What the fuck are you even talking about,” Feng Xin said, much more softly than Mu Qing was expecting. “Why wouldn’t I break the curse with you? That’s literally all we’ve been fucking trying to do for <em>weeks</em> now.”</p><p>“You — you can’t be this much of an idiot,” Mu Qing choked out. “It’s not a problem for you anymore! You can just wait a few days and the curse will be fucking gone without you having to do anything! Why go to all the effort of — of having me t-touch you if you don’t have to?!”</p><p>“Mu Qing. Come on.”</p><p>Feng Xin peeled Mu Qing’s nearest hand away from the edge of the couch-bed and took it into both of his own, then started up a stream of qi. </p><p>Mu Qing made a small noise at the sudden warmth and softness of Feng Xin’s hands enveloping his own — it was overwhelming, his skin incredibly sensitive, yet the touch still calmed him somehow, and his breathing slowed away from the edge of hyperventilation.</p><p>“Of course it’s still a problem for me,” Feng Xin said seriously. “Even if I was completely cured of the curse right this fucking second, it’d still be a problem for me, because it’s still affecting <em>you</em>.” He scowled. “I’m not going to just fucking — let you suffer with it forever, or whatever the fuck you thought I was going to do.”</p><p>“…Probably leave me to the whims of the medical gods,” Mu Qing huffed.</p><p>Feng Xin scowled even harder. “What the hell?! No fucking way am I letting those assholes touch you like that!”</p><p>His reaction was so unexpectedly strong that Mu Qing felt the urge to push a little.</p><p>“Or maybe Pei Ming,” he suggested, trying to keep a straight face so that it wasn’t immediately obvious he wasn’t serious.</p><p>“WHAT?! You can’t seriously fucking think I — fucking <em>Pei Ming</em>?!?! What in the goddamn — Oh.” Feng Xin cut himself off, having caught sight of the smirk Mu Qing could no longer hold back. “You’re just messing with me. Thank fuck.” </p><p>He tipped his head back against the wall and closed his eyes in relief.</p><p>Then he opened them and caught Mu Qing’s gaze, giving him an intense look. “I really do mean it, though. We’re breaking this fucking curse together. Even if I can wait it out, I’d still rather have you break it for me. And I want to be the one to break yours, if you’ll let me.” </p><p>Feng Xin squeezed his hand, his dark eyes pinning Mu Qing in place. “Please, Mu Qing. I want to help. Please let me help.”</p><p>…Fuck.</p><p>Feng Xin could really kill a man with that kind of sincerity, and Mu Qing found himself just as weak to it now as he had been for the past eight centuries.</p><p>“Alright,” Mu Qing said softly, and squeezed Feng Xin’s hands right back.</p><p>“Okay. Okay, good.” Feng Xin finally broke the intense eye contact, relaxing into the couch-bed. He didn’t let go of Mu Qing’s hand, though. “Then…do you want to try to break it tonight?”</p><p>Oh, fuck, tonight was so soon. Mu Qing had been hoping to have a little more time to prepare so he didn’t embarrass himself the instant Feng Xin touched anywhere more intimate than his hands.</p><p>Feng Xin must have felt him tense up, because he quickly said, “I can go first if you want. Then we can wait and make sure it actually is permanent before we break it for you?”</p><p>“Alright. Yeah,” Mu Qing said weakly. “Tonight, then.”</p><p>“Tonight.”</p>

  <p>Mu Qing had been thinking about the way Feng Xin had passionately insisted that they break the curse for each other all day. He thought about it while bathing, while supervising his deputies’ training, while attempting to answer prayers, and while straightening his room in an attempt to make the time until Feng Xin’s arrival pass faster.</p><p>He thought about it so much that he no longer had any idea what it meant at all.</p><p>Maybe Feng Xin was just being as intense as always, being a good friend, a good person — or maybe, just maybe, his enthusiasm stemmed from wanting an excuse to get his hands on Mu Qing, just like Mu Qing was eager to get his hands on Feng Xin.</p><p>It was impossible to tell.</p><p>Rationally, the former was more likely, but Mu Qing couldn’t break the tentative thread of hope at the idea of the latter. Wouldn’t it be incredible, if Feng Xin too had been feeling this sense of giddy, nervous anticipation all day? </p><p>Incredible, and unbelievable. There was no way. </p><p>But hadn’t all sorts of unbelievable things been happening lately?</p><p> </p><p>They’d agreed to meet after the sun had set, but to Mu Qing’s surprise, Feng Xin arrived early.</p><p>The sun had just barely touched the horizon when his deputies notified him that General Nan Yang had entered the palace, and in no time at all Mu Qing heard Feng Xin approach his bedroom door.</p><p>After possibly the most tentative knock that Mu Qing had ever heard, he opened the door to find Feng Xin frowning and standing there awkwardly, red in the face and holding a large glass jar full of dark powder — presumably the bath salts that he’d tasked the other man with fetching from Pei Ming’s palace.</p><p>Feng Xin wouldn’t even meet Mu Qing’s eyes as he stepped inside the room without a word, his posture stiff and uncomfortable.</p><p>“What? What is it?” Mu Qing snapped, when Feng Xin still said nothing and made no move to hand over the jar. “If you’ve changed your mind about me touching you, just say so.”</p><p>Feng Xin snapped out of whatever daze he’d been in. “No! No, I haven’t changed my mind,” he said. His face was still flushed, but his expression was intense. “I want you to.”</p><p>He held Mu Qing’s gaze for so long that Mu Qing had to look away, feeling like he was getting rather flushed himself. “Then what was that face for?”</p><p>“It’s just —” Feng Xin sighed, dragging a hand over his face. “Pei Ming was being his usual self, and by that I mean fucking annoying as hell. He…said some stuff that made me think, that’s all.”</p><p>Mu Qing snorted. “Made you think? That’s impressive. Most of what comes out of his mouth just makes me want to punch something.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes widened — and then his face split into a grin entirely too bright for Mu Qing’s heart to handle. </p><p>“Aw, that’s a bit harsh. Why not think and punch things at the same time?”</p><p>Mu Qing raised an eyebrow. “…Mm. I’ll allow it on the condition that it’s Pei Ming’s palace being punched.”</p><p>Feng Xin laughed, loud and bright. “I have to say, it does feel nice to not be on the receiving end of your insults for once. Careful, Xuan Zhen, or I’ll think you’re going soft on me.”</p><p>“Hmph.” Mu Qing rolled his eyes, but offered no further response.</p><p>Feng Xin did seem to be offering the insult opportunities up on a plate tonight (why not think and punch things at the same time? Come on.) but Mu Qing was entirely too distracted to follow through with them.</p><p>If anything, it was Mu Qing who couldn’t do both at the same time as of late — ever since Feng Xin had started getting more touchy with him, he’d been losing to Feng Xin during spars more often, so aware of everywhere they were touching that he’d get distracted and leave himself open. Even more annoyingly, it was hard to muster up the usual dismay about losing when it felt so nice to have Feng Xin pinning him down, his weight pressing him into the ground.</p><p>Fuck. Thinking about sparring the way they used to before they were cursed made Mu Qing even more antsy to break the curse as soon as possible.</p><p>“The sooner we get started, the sooner we can be done, so hand over the bath salts and strip,” he said, trying not to let the sudden surge of eagerness show on his face.</p><p>Feng Xin looked inexplicably disappointed for a second. “…Right.” Then he handed the jar to Mu Qing, his expression smoothing over into determination.</p><p>With the bath salts in hand, Mu Qing headed over to the large bathtub behind the divider, trying his best to ignore the soft sounds of Feng Xin’s robes dropping to the floor behind him.</p><p>The tub was already full of hot water, kept warm with talismans. Mu Qing poured some of the bath salts in and stirred the water with a hand, and after a moment, the water turned a deep blueish-purple, and a sharp medicinal scent began to waft up from the bath.</p><p>When Mu Qing took his hand out of the water, the skin was tinted purple exactly where he’d submerged it, just dark enough to show where the curse was active. There was no indication of where Feng Xin had held his hand to calm him down with his qi that morning — so the curse was apparently already back in full strength.</p><p>Seeing the curse so visible on his hand like that gave him an idea, and he quickly dipped his other hand into the water too.</p><p>Maybe it was selfish of him, but if he was going to be touching Feng Xin, he wanted to be able to actually <em>feel</em> it. There was no guarantee Mu Qing would ever have another chance to touch Feng Xin so thoroughly and in such an intimate setting, after all — unless his delusions about the reason for Feng Xin’s enthusiasm were somehow right, they would surely go back to just casual touches after tonight. And that was assuming Feng Xin even wanted to keep touching him at all.</p><p>So yes, Mu Qing wanted to be able to feel this.</p><p>“Come here and do my hands before you get in the bath,” Mu Qing called, not daring to look around the divider in case Feng Xin was already completely bare.</p><p>Feng Xin padded up behind Mu Qing, thankfully still wearing his inner robe, and made a small noise upon seeing Mu Qing’s arms.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“More purple than I expected,” he said. Then he gently took one of Mu Qing’s hands into both his own.</p><p>At first, it was strange like always, seeing their skin touch but not being able to feel it at all, but then Feng Xin pushed some spiritual energy into his skin and started moving his fingers and…<em>oh</em>.</p><p>It took everything Mu Qing had not to gasp at the overwhelming rush of warmth and sensation. How did it feel so much more intense than just earlier today?</p><p>It was like his nerve endings were extra-sensitive after being blocked for so long — every brush of Feng Xin’s fingers against his hand felt like molten lightning down his spine. The contrast between the gentleness of his touch and the roughness of his calluses against the delicate skin between Mu Qing’s fingers felt like it was driving him insane.</p><p>It was…fuck.</p><p>If he was this affected just from Feng Xin touching his hand, he was going to actually die when Feng Xin removed the curse from the rest of his body.</p><p>Oblivious to Mu Qing’s suffering, Feng Xin continued to massage his hand, erasing the purple tint of the curse completely. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think you wanted me to remove the curse from your hands first so you don’t miss out on feeling me up.” His tone was teasing, clearly not serious, so it was unfortunate that he was unintentionally fully correct.</p><p>Mu Qing was in no state to lie convincingly, but he was damn well going to try anyway. “Shut <em>up</em>,” he said through clenched teeth. “Maybe I just don’t want to hurt you because I can’t tell how hard I’m pressing, ever think of that?”</p><p>Feng Xin paused to stare at Mu Qing, eyes wide, and accidentally let Mu Qing’s hand slip from between his fingers.</p><p>Belatedly, Mu Qing realized that that statement might actually be more revealing than just admitting his desire to touch him.</p><p>Feng Xin stared at him for so long that Mu Qing was starting to feel a strong urge to flee. Finally, he picked up Mu Qing’s hand again and said, “I — that’s… Thanks. I…was kind of glad I’m going first, so I can feel what I’m doing to you too.”</p><p>Something about the phrasing of that made Mu Qing feel hot inside. “…Good. That’s — good.”</p><p>“I didn’t hurt <em>you</em> just now, did I? Your face is doing something weird.”</p><p>“No!” Turning him on was probably the opposite of hurting him, actually, but it wasn’t like Mu Qing could just come out and say that. “It’s fine. Just…hurry the fuck up already.” He wiggled his hand impatiently in Feng Xin’s grip.</p><p>When Feng Xin began to caress his hand again, Mu Qing was prepared for it this time — but being prepared didn’t make the sensation any less intense, and on the heels of Feng Xin’s admission he was too overwhelmed to stifle a small gasp. </p><p>Feng Xin was just so warm, and standing so close, and looking at him so softly — he felt like his expression must be giving away everything, spread open with his heart on display for Feng Xin to take. But Feng Xin didn’t say anything, or make any indication that he’d noticed how hard Mu Qing’s heart was pounding — he just kept looking at Mu Qing and softly running his fingers over both of his hands. </p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Mu Qing dropped his gaze and saw that his hands were free of the curse up to the wrists, so he reluctantly tugged them out of Feng Xin’s grasp and gestured to the bathtub.</p><p>“Go on, then.” </p><p>Feng Xin nodded, and Mu Qing stepped back out of the bathing area to let him dunk himself in the curse-revealing water in privacy, trying to keep his gaze from lingering too long on Feng Xin’s silhouette through the divider as he got into the tub.</p><p>Still flustered, Mu Qing tried to distract himself by thinking practical thoughts. How exactly was this going to work? Should they do the curse-removing on the bed? Or would that be too intimate for what amounted to a medical procedure? </p><p>If it felt even close to as intense for Feng Xin as it did for Mu Qing, he wouldn’t want to be standing, though, and Mu Qing didn’t really have a huge variety of seating options in his room. </p><p>So bed it was, even if the idea made his stomach flip.</p><p>After a few minutes, Feng Xin emerged from behind the divider, his inner robes hanging loose to offer a tempting view of his sculpted torso. His hair was messy like it had been towel-dried, but the rest of him still looked slightly damp and…very purple. </p><p>It seemed like he’d been correct about the curse fading for him — the dye was concentrated in the upper left of his body, at its darkest on his left hand where the ghost had touched him directly, and fading out diagonally across his torso with just a small sliver disappearing under his waistband at the left hip.</p><p>Mu Qing huffed out a laugh, some of his nerves alleviating at how ridiculous Feng Xin looked with the curse-revealing dye staining his skin. If Mu Qing could just focus on the color, and not Feng Xin’s…<em>everything else</em>…maybe they could get through this unscathed.</p><p>“I know, I don’t know why it looks so much darker on me than you,” Feng Xin chuckled good-naturedly. “…Actually, I bet I just stayed under the water too long.”</p><p>He was standing so close — Mu Qing could practically feel the humidity radiating off of him. And how did he still smell so good despite having just used the weirdly-scented bath salts? It was so annoying. It made Mu Qing want to bury his face in Feng Xin’s neck.</p><p>“So. How do you want to do this?”</p><p>Mu Qing gestured to the bed. “Let’s start with your face, and…and go from there.” </p><p>The longer this went on, the less willpower Mu Qing would have to restrain himself from kissing Feng Xin, so it was best to get the lip-touching out of the way as quickly as possible.</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Feng Xin said, voice soft. “But you’re sure you’re okay getting the dye from the bath salts on the sheets? I don’t mind if we do it while I’m standing, if you’d rather not…”</p><p>Mu Qing looked away, trying not to think of ‘doing it while standing’ against the wall, or pressed up to the door. </p><p>“It’s fine,” he said, voice strained. “It probably won’t stain, but even if it does, they’re hardly my nicest sheets.”</p><p>“Ah. Right.”</p><p>Despite his agreement, Feng Xin still didn’t move towards the bed, so Mu Qing put a hand on his chest to gently push him in the right direction — and almost yanked it away again in surprise at the still-new and intense sensation of Feng Xin warm and solid against his skin.</p><p>Hopefully he would get used to the feeling soon, or it was going to be a very awkward evening.</p><p>After being nudged, Feng Xin seemed much less hesitant to get on the bed. Mu Qing followed, and settled into the sheets, facing Feng Xin with his legs tucked underneath him.</p><p>Hoping his hands weren’t shaking too visibly, Mu Qing lifted them to Feng Xin’s face. He started up a steady stream of qi through his fingertips, and at the first smooth of Mu Qing’s thumbs over his cheeks, Feng Xin’s breath hitched, his eyes fluttering shut. </p><p>All the better — this would be much easier if Feng Xin wasn’t staring at him the whole time.</p><p>“I forgot how nice it is,” Feng Xin breathed after a moment, voice a little unsteady.</p><p>“How nice what is?” Mu Qing’s voice came out low and soft, matching Feng Xin’s volume.</p><p>“…You touching me. Your hands. They’re so fucking warm…”</p><p>Mu Qing didn’t know what to say to that, so he just hummed and focused on keeping his touch gentle and the flow of his spiritual energy steady as he slowly cleared the purple of the curse from Feng Xin’s skin.</p><p>The physical sensation wasn’t quite as overwhelming now that he wasn’t the one being touched and receiving qi, but the view was still incredibly distracting — Feng Xin really was extremely beautiful.</p><p>It was a challenge not to get lost in looking at him on a normal day, let alone when Mu Qing was allowed to stare and touch all he liked. His strong jaw; the cute fuzz below his sideburns; his thick eyebrows and the ever-present crease between them; his proud nose…</p><p>Mu Qing averted his eyes before they could drop any further. He really couldn’t let himself look at Feng Xin’s lips yet, or he wouldn’t be able to stop thinking about kissing them.</p><p>“Keep your eyes closed,” he said softly.</p><p>Feng Xin hummed in acknowledgement, so Mu Qing trailed his fingers towards the corner of his eyes, trying to telegraph that he was about to touch his eyelids. He moved extra slowly around Feng Xin’s eyes, both to be careful with the delicate skin and to prolong the amount of time he could look at Feng Xin without being watched in return.</p><p>“So gentle,” Feng Xin murmured.</p><p>Mu Qing huffed. “Did you expect I wouldn’t be? I <em>told</em> you —”</p><p>“No, it’s not that!” Feng Xin rushed to say. “It’s just…it’s kind of ticklish, that’s all.”</p><p>“Would you rather I be firm then?” In demonstration, Mu Qing let his fingers move against his cheek like they would if he were doing this to someone else — a stranger perhaps. It wasn’t rough exactly, just…brisk and clinical.</p><p>Feng Xin’s mouth twisted, not quite a frown. “I…guess not. Can I open my eyes yet?”</p><p>Actually, it’d be best if Feng Xin kept his eyes closed while Mu Qing did his lips, too. Mu Qing wasn’t at all confident he’d be able to hide how much he wanted to just fall forward and kiss him breathless.</p><p>“Not yet.”</p><p>Mu Qing stopped for a moment, trying not to stare at Feng Xin’s mouth and utterly failing. Before he could lose his nerve, he slowly dragged a thumb over his bottom lip.</p><p>…Fuck, it was so <em>soft</em>…he really could just lean in and —</p><p>— Not feel their lips connect anyway, because his own mouth was still affected by the curse. He’d probably just smash their faces together. Ugh.</p><p>Not realizing that he’d frozen for several seconds with his thumb pressed into Feng Xin’s lips, he looked up suddenly to find that Feng Xin had opened his eyes and was now staring at him, eyes molten and dark. </p><p>Then, Feng Xin’s mouth moved ever so slightly under his thumb. It was such a minute movement Mu Qing couldn’t even see it, but it <em>felt</em> like a kiss, and Mu Qing sucked in a shaky breath, his face burning up with how hot he suddenly felt. </p><p>He couldn’t stop thinking about Feng Xin kissing all of his fingers, about what Feng Xin would do if he slid his fingers into his mouth, if it would turn him on as much as just the thought of it was affecting Mu Qing right now. </p><p>Fuck.</p><p>As quickly as he could while still clearing away the curse, Mu Qing brushed his thumb over Feng Xin’s top lip as well, and then dropped his hands completely, feeling breathless and dizzy, fingers tingling where they had touched Feng Xin.</p><p>This was insane. Did it only feel this intense because of the curse and sharing spiritual energy, or would it always have been like this if he’d ever had a chance to touch Feng Xin this intimately before? Would it still be this overwhelming after the curse was gone?</p><p>If Mu Qing thought too hard about it, he’d lose it more than he already was, so he took a deep breath to refocus, then used Feng Xin’s chin to turn his face to the side so Mu Qing could clear the curse from his ears, avoiding Feng Xin’s burning gaze.</p><p>He had to lean in fairly close to make sure he was fully removing the purple of the curse. Abruptly, Feng Xin giggled, and Mu Qing glared at him halfheartedly.</p><p>“What is it now?”</p><p>“It just tickles! I can feel you breathing in my ear!”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes, then purposefully puffed a breath into Feng Xin’s ear.</p><p>He didn’t laugh again like Mu Qing had been hoping, but he did shiver, and Mu Qing had a front row seat to his ear turning a delightful shade of pink. It made Mu Qing want to do it again.</p><p>Resisting the urge, Mu Qing pulled back and turned Feng Xin’s head again to clear the curse from the other ear: the one with the single gold earring.</p><p>As he leaned in, he noticed something shocking — from a distance, the earring had appeared to be a smooth gold, but up close Mu Qing could see the faded remnants of an engraved pattern. It almost looked like —</p><p>The more he looked, the more certain Mu Qing became: this was almost definitely the earring he had gifted Feng Xin over 800 years ago, the pattern worn down over time but still unmistakably there.</p><p>Back then, he’d rarely had the money for gifts, but one year, one of the children who lived on his mother’s street had proudly presented him with a set of plain gold earrings. She’d apparently received them from some distant family member who didn’t know she had no interest in jewelry, and had kept them aside for him, because “Gege would look pretty with earrings!”</p><p>Mu Qing didn’t have the heart to tell her that he had no interest in wearing earrings either, so he’d tried to convince her to sell them for money or keep them herself, but she was quite stubborn, and he ended up accepting the gift just to avoid her pitiful puppy-eyes. </p><p>…It had absolutely nothing to do with the fact that he’d suddenly remembered that Feng Xin had had a single ear piercing for as long as they’d known each other.</p><p>For weeks, the earrings had sat tucked away in a folded-up cloth on Mu Qing’s bedside table, untouched, until finally he could no longer stand to just look at them every night.</p><p>Something about how plain they were was bothering him, so Mu Qing had decided to use a needle to engrave a simple pattern into them. He’d never tried engraving before, but it turned out he was just as much of a perfectionist about it as he was about sewing — it took so long to finish both earrings to his satisfaction that Feng Xin’s birthday came and went by the time he was done, and he was left to stare at them as they sat on his bedside table once again.</p><p>There was no way Mu Qing could give him a gift on just a random day — giving him a gift at all was already nearly too much — so there had been really nothing he could do about it but wait. He’d give one to Feng Xin next year, if he didn’t lose his nerve.</p><p>But there was no next year, because Xie Lian had been banished before Feng Xin’s next birthday: there’d been no time at all to think about gifts, or feelings, or anything at all besides doing what they needed to survive, and so the earrings lay forgotten at the bottom of Mu Qing’s bag, unseen and untouched until years later.</p><p>It wasn’t until Mu Qing had left to become a middle court official again that he was reminded of their existence.</p><p>When he’d unpacked his bag at his mother’s house, the earrings had fallen out, and Mu Qing had been hit with a sudden wave of emotion. It wasn’t quite regret — he would never regret choosing his mother, as much as he hated being forced to choose — but more a sense of melancholy, of grief, like he’d somehow lost something that was never even his to begin with.</p><p>From that day on he’d kept one of the earrings on him at all times, tucked safely away in a small pouch.</p><p>On the day that Mu Qing snuck away from his heavenly duties to bring rice to his former companions, Feng Xin had opened the door after he knocked, looking exhausted, surprised, and shockingly — relieved, and maybe even a bit pleased. </p><p>He’d invited Mu Qing inside and talked with him all day as if there had never been any animosity between them, and Mu Qing had felt a bit dazed at how well it was going compared to his encounter with Xie Lian a few days prior.</p><p>That evening, softened by Feng Xin’s warm reception and tired smile, Mu Qing had managed to work up the nerve to finally give Feng Xin the earring he carried with him. </p><p>Under Feng Xin’s soft gaze, Mu Qing had admitted that he’d meant to give it to him long ago, and insisted that Feng Xin should sell it since they needed money. Even if his traitorous heart twinged at the thought of it being sold, it would have kept them in food and medicine until the next time Mu Qing could bring more supplies, and their survival was the only thing that truly mattered.</p><p>But Feng Xin had insisted that he’d only sell it if it was absolutely necessary, and laid his hands on Mu Qing’s forearms with something akin to warmth in his eyes — and for the first time in years Mu Qing had thought they might actually be okay.</p><p>Then Xie Lian had returned, and the warm welcome Feng Xin had given him turned to ice.</p><p>Xie Lian’s voice repeatedly telling him to leave and Feng Xin’s insistence that he never wanted to see Mu Qing again had rung in Mu Qing’s ears long after he’d left — after such a parting Mu Qing had been sure that Feng Xin would have immediately sold the earring, eager to be rid of anything associated with him.</p><p>…But here they were, more than 800 years later, with clear evidence to the contrary resting at Mu Qing’s fingertips.</p><p>Mu Qing felt lightheaded, unbalanced.</p><p>Why in the world would Feng Xin still have the earring, after a fight like that? Let alone be actively wearing it after so many years?</p><p>“Feng Xin? Is this…?”</p><p>Feng Xin startled, like the question had shaken him out of a trance. “Hm?”</p><p>“This,” Mu Qing said, gently thumbing at the earring. “Is it…the same one that I…?”</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes widened in realization. “Oh, that. Y-yeah.” Even though Mu Qing wasn’t close enough to be breathing on his ear anymore, the tips of his ears flushed again. “I’m surprised you didn’t notice it before, honestly. I can’t remember the last time I took it off.”</p><p>“How could I notice when the engravings are this worn down? It could have been any regular gold earring for all I knew!”</p><p>“And how is that my fault?! It’s not like I haven’t been taking care of it, otherwise it wouldn’t even still be in one fucking piece after 800 years!”</p><p>They had fallen easily into bickering as usual, but Mu Qing abruptly went silent at the admission that Feng Xin had not only been wearing the earring all these years — he’d been purposefully taking care of it.</p><p>“Why…why do you even still have it?” Mu Qing asked quietly. “You both needed money so badly. And you hated me. Why hang on to a reminder of someone you hated?” </p><p>Cupping Feng Xin’s jaw with his free hand, he began working on removing the curse from Feng Xin’s ear again, needing an excuse to avoid Feng Xin’s gaze and a distraction from his own turbulent emotions.</p><p>“To be honest, I did think about selling it,” Feng Xin admitted, equally as quietly. “But I promised I wouldn’t unless I really needed to. And it was…I don’t know. The only thing I had left of you, I guess. It wasn’t worth it to give that up just for a few days’ worth of busking money.” He sighed, and leaned into Mu Qing’s hand where it was resting against the side of his face. “I didn’t hate you, you know. I was really fucking angry at you back then, but I never hated you.”</p><p>Mu Qing found that hard to believe, but for once he didn’t particularly feel like arguing about it. At the very least, it was certainly hard for even the most pessimistic parts of his mind to believe that Feng Xin hated him <em>now</em>, with the way he relaxed into Mu Qing’s touch, wearing Mu Qing’s gift, sitting in Mu Qing’s bed.</p><p>He thought of the earring’s twin, stored carefully in the back of his desk drawer inside a sealed box that was enchanted to prevent corrosion, and his next words slipped out of him before he could even think of stopping them.</p><p>“I’ve…never hated you, either.” Feng Xin’s cheek moved against Mu Qing’s hand as he smiled, and Mu Qing flushed, feeling warm. He hurriedly continued before Feng Xin could say anything, “Still. Didn’t you ever find anything you liked better? It was kind of plain even when it was new. Clearly amateur craftsmanship.”</p><p>“Nah, I like it just the way it is,” Feng Xin said with a wry grin. “You’ve accused me of having simple tastes often enough, I don’t know why you’re surprised.”  </p><p>“Hmph.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s ear was fully de-purpled now, and only his neck was left before he’d have to start removing clothes. Mu Qing took a steadying breath, then gently set his hands against Feng Xin’s neck, smoothing up and down in large sweeps of his palms. Feng Xin let out a shaky breath as Mu Qing’s fingers caressed the back of his neck, and another when his thumbs grazed his collarbones.</p><p>Reluctant to stop touching Feng Xin, Mu Qing left his hands resting on either side of Feng Xin’s neck for a long moment, letting his thumbs brush just behind his ears. </p><p>Feng Xin shuddered and looked at him with dark eyes, but didn’t tell him to stop, and Mu Qing once again had to resist the powerful urge to lean in and kiss him. Finally, he pulled his hands back. They really had to move on.</p><p>“Well, go on,” Mu Qing said impatiently, gesturing to Feng Xin’s torso. “Take off the robe then.”</p><p>Standing up, Feng Xin shucked off the robe and tossed it somewhere on Mu Qing’s floor before settling back onto the bed. Luckily for him, the view was distracting enough that Mu Qing couldn’t manage to string together enough words to complain about it.</p><p>It wasn’t like Mu Qing had never seen Feng Xin shirtless. On the contrary, he’d probably seen Feng Xin shirtless more often than he’d seen anyone else in <em>any</em> state of undress — even more than Pei Ming, who was seemingly obsessed with training while half-naked.</p><p>It was just…something about knowing that he was allowed to <em>touch</em> this time that had his hands shaking with nerves. Even though the view was stranger than usual, what with the purple tint, Feng Xin was still breathtaking — all corded muscle and broad archer’s shoulders.</p><p>Mu Qing swallowed dryly. Somehow he felt even less ready for this than when they started.</p><p>He reached out, intending to start near Feng Xin’s collarbones where he’d left off, but Feng Xin suddenly raised an arm to block him.</p><p>“Wait — could you…do my hand first actually?”</p><p>Feng Xin paused, looking like he wanted to say something else, but when nothing was forthcoming, Mu Qing nodded and held out his own hand.</p><p>Face turning red again, Feng Xin placed his left hand into Mu Qing’s.</p><p>Their hands were about the same size, but where Mu Qing’s fingers were long, Feng Xin’s palms were large. He also had calluses in different places than Mu Qing — most notably on the sides of his fingers, rough from inconsistent use of his archery gloves.</p><p>Mu Qing lost himself in touching Feng Xin’s hand, trying to memorize the feeling of it in his own. He took his time slowly stroking over each finger and letting his qi sink into Feng Xin’s skin, rubbing circles into his palm even after the purple of the curse was fully removed.</p><p>Feng Xin probably wasn’t enjoying this as much as Mu Qing was, but at least he didn’t seem to hate how it felt, with the way his fingers sometimes twitched closer as if to chase Mu Qing’s touch, and how his eyes were closed, his expression relaxed. </p><p>When Mu Qing increased the pressure, digging his thumb into the tense muscles of Feng Xin’s palm and stretching his fingers in the same way he did to his own hands when they got stiff from too much paperwork, Feng Xin let out a groan.</p><p>Mu Qing froze at the noise — it was hard to tell whether it was from pain or pleasure.</p><p>“…Huh? Why’d you stop?”</p><p>“I don’t know, why did you make that noise?”</p><p>Feng Xin furrowed his brow in confusion. “What noise?”</p><p>So it was entirely involuntary, then. “Never mind.” Mu Qing picked up Feng Xin’s hand to resume the massage, and watched as his eyes slid closed again, like a contented cat — hopefully that meant the groan hadn’t been one of pain.</p><p>Confirmation that Feng Xin did indeed like it came only a moment later. “Mmm, how are you so good at this,” he mumbled. “Feels like…like you’re rearranging my bones. But in a good way…”</p><p>“What is there to be good at?” Mu Qing scoffed. “It’s less about my skill and more that you’re just ridiculously tense. It wouldn’t get this bad if you actually stretched your hands occasionally.”</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” Feng Xin said, with no heat behind it. “I do stretch! But it never helps as much as this. Just fucking take the compliment for once.”</p><p>Mu Qing’s cheeks heated and, not trusting his voice, he simply hummed in acknowledgment. </p><p>When Feng Xin’s hand felt sufficiently loose, Mu Qing moved on to his wrist, lightening his touch again in an effort not to get too distracted by all the firm muscle under his hands. The hand massage was already pushing it — if he did the same with Feng Xin’s arm, it would be much too obvious that Mu Qing was dragging this out for no reason other than simply wanting to touch Feng Xin as much as possible — blatant appreciation with no plausible excuse.</p><p>Feng Xin shivered as Mu Qing swiped his thumbs over his inner wrist.</p><p>The overly hopeful part of Mu Qing’s brain eagerly made a note of that under ‘places Feng Xin might enjoy being kissed’, but he quickly shoved the thought down with practiced ease and kept working, mind carefully blank as he worked his qi up over Feng Xin’s forearm.</p><p>Then Feng Xin shivered again as Mu Qing’s hands moved up his inner forearm, and made a noise of discontent, cracking an eye open to look at Mu Qing. “Why so soft all of a sudden? It’s ticklish.”</p><p>Mu Qing huffed. No appreciation at all for his efforts not to make this more awkward than it already was. “What, you want me to rearrange the bones of your arm too?”</p><p>“I mean…yeah?” Feng Xin’s cheeks went a little red, and his arm flexed under Mu Qing’s hands like he was thinking about pulling away. “Not that this is bad! It’s fine! It’s just…what you were doing to my hand was — really fucking nice. And I’m pretty sure my hands aren’t the only places that are tense, so…”</p><p>There was a long pause while Mu Qing tried to digest that Feng Xin was — was he basically asking for a full body massage?! No — that was — Mu Qing couldn’t think of it like that. It was just that Mu Qing already had to touch half of his body to remove the curse, so why not take advantage of the opportunity to work out some tension along the way, right?</p><p>Fuck, putting it that way made it sound even more salacious. Mu Qing’s face was going to catch on fire if it got any warmer.</p><p>His silence appeared to be making Feng Xin uncomfortable, though, because he suddenly laughed awkwardly and rubbed at the back of his neck with the hand Mu Qing wasn’t holding. “Fuck, I mean — you don’t have to! I know you probably just want to hurry up and get this over w—”</p><p>“Fine,” Mu Qing interrupted, face aflame.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes went wide. “W-what?”</p><p>“I said, fine. If — if you’re sure you want me to.” Mu Qing pulled Feng Xin a little closer and began digging his fingers into Feng Xin’s wrist and forearm, slowly working out the tension — of which there was indeed rather a lot. The downsides of being an archer, he supposed. “…Like that?”</p><p>“Mmm, yeah,” Feng Xin groaned, his eyes falling shut again. Mu Qing was glad for it — if Feng Xin was going to keep sounding that indecent, he wasn’t sure he’d be able to control his expression — or his body’s reaction, for that matter.</p><p>As Mu Qing continued massaging his arm, working up from the wrist all the way up to the shoulder, Feng Xin became more and more limp in his hands, sagging back against the headboard. He seemed so relaxed that he was almost on the verge of falling asleep. Still, despite how out of it he seemed, Mu Qing was at least expecting a reaction when he began to move from his shoulder over his collarbone, and down to his chest — but Feng Xin hardly seemed to notice, other than letting out an appreciative moan when Mu Qing began to apply pressure just under his collarbone.</p><p>Mu Qing, on the other hand, was becoming increasingly flustered, and had to take a moment to catch his breath before continuing. This was really — Feng Xin was really fine with him just — feeling up his chest like this. Fuck.</p><p>Steeling his nerves, Mu Qing went ahead and just — cupped Feng Xin’s pecs in both of his palms. Feng Xin inhaled audibly, but said nothing, still relaxed against the headboard, so Mu Qing began to move, pressing into the muscle.</p><p>Like everywhere else Mu Qing had touched so far, Feng Xin’s chest was somehow both hard and soft at once, and Mu Qing had the sudden, involuntary thought that it must be incredibly comfortable to sleep on.</p><p>Even in the past few years of occasionally spending the night in Feng Xin's bed to comfort him after nightmares, it was always Feng Xin sleeping on Mu Qing's chest, never the other way around, and for as often as they’d slept in the same bed when they were young, Mu Qing had never had the nerve to attempt to cuddle with Feng Xin at all back then, let alone sleep against his chest. As far as he knew, Feng Xin would have hated it if he had.</p><p>Although…there had been a few nights where he’d half woken up, feeling unusually warm, and fallen back asleep so quickly he’d had no time to question the warmth. He’d always woken alone, though, and assumed he’d dreamed up the comforting heat against his back.</p><p>Mu Qing continued to knead at Feng Xin’s chest, massaging down his ribs, over his stomach and sides, lost in thought. Technically, it wasn’t necessary to do this to the right side of Feng Xin’s torso, since the curse had already faded there, but it would hardly be helpful to knead out the tension on only one side, would it? It was a good thing the purple of the curse steadily disappearing was such a visible reminder of the progress he was meant to be making — otherwise he could have easily done this for hours, distracted as he was.</p><p>Every small noise of satisfaction Feng Xin made added to the pleasant haze of arousal Mu Qing had been in for most of the night, and he was starting to grow addicted to them, focusing his efforts in the areas that made Feng Xin moan the most.</p><p>It was really unfair how small Feng Xin’s waist was, in comparison to his broad shoulders. That was another thing his worshippers often got wrong with his statues — they made him built like a brick, totally unappreciative of the contrasting curves of his actual figure.</p><p>And his narrow hips, so perfect for Mu Qing to hold onto, those beautiful lines directing the eye — and Mu Qing’s hands — downwards —</p><p>When Mu Qing’s fingers grazed the waistline of his pants, Feng Xin startled, tensing up under Mu Qing’s palms. The sudden movement also startled Mu Qing out of the haze he’d fallen into, and he quickly withdrew his hands.</p><p>The curse was almost entirely gone from Feng Xin’s front, save for a small strip of purple that disappeared under the waistband of his pants on his left hip. It didn’t look like it went too far down, but Mu Qing still swallowed, his throat dry.</p><p>“Do you want to. P-pull down your pants?” he said, a little breathless. “On — on the left side. Where the curse is,” he clarified hurriedly.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes dropped to Mu Qing’s hands for a moment, then flicked back up to his face, heated and dark.</p><p>“You should do it,” he said hoarsely.</p><p>“W-what?”</p><p>Feng Xin groaned, hiding his reddening face with an arm. “Fuck. You — you can pull them down. I don’t mind.”</p><p>He tilted his hips, probably intending it to be some sort of invitation, but the sight of it made a hot wave of arousal sweep through Mu Qing, and he nearly gasped, steadying himself against the bed. Thank fuck for past Mu Qing’s foresight in choosing robes that were both capable of hiding how hard he was, and dark enough not to betray how much he was already leaking even though Feng Xin hadn’t touched him at all yet.</p><p>Mu Qing searched Feng Xin’s expression, but he seemed to be sincere, if a little flustered, so he slowly reached out a hand towards Feng Xin’s left hip. His breathing sped up, and his eyes seemed laser-focused on Mu Qing’s hand, but he didn’t stop him, so Mu Qing gingerly tucked two fingers underneath his waistband and tugged it down just far enough to see where the curse ended, just a hand-width below his hip.</p><p>It was hardly any more indecent than before, but the top of Feng Xin’s thigh was just visible, and Mu Qing had a sudden urge to lick the crease of it where it met his pelvis.</p><p>Fuck. He really needed to pull himself together.</p><p>Closing his eyes for a moment to refocus, Mu Qing took a deep breath, calmed his qi, and then laid a hand on Feng Xin’s exposed hip.</p><p>Feng Xin inhaled sharply, and tipped his head back against the headboard. He was much more tense than before, so Mu Qing did his best to work quickly. He couldn’t stop thinking about how this could have gone if the curse hadn’t faded for Feng Xin — how he would have gotten to strip Feng Xin fully. If Feng Xin was really serious about being tense everywhere, he could have massaged his thighs, and ass, and — <em>fuck</em>.</p><p>Mu Qing had to stop thinking about this.</p><p>As soon as the curse was gone, he pulled Feng Xin’s waistband back up and let himself fall backwards on the bed, covering his face with a sleeve and making sure his knee was strategically bent to hide the situation in his pants.</p><p>Feng Xin made a noise of concern. “Mu Qing? Fuck, what’s wrong?”</p><p>Peeking out from behind his sleeve, Mu Qing saw that Feng Xin was hovering over him, frowning quite impressively. “Nothing’s wrong,” he mumbled.</p><p>“Then why the fuck did you suddenly fall over like that?”</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “Am I not allowed to want a break?”</p><p>Impossibly, Feng Xin’s scowl grew even deeper. “What, are you tired already? I knew you hadn’t been fucking resting enough, there’s no way that was enough qi to make you —”</p><p>“Shut up! Did I say I was tired?” Mu Qing covered his face with his sleeve again and thrust his other hand in Feng Xin’s direction, halfway hoping it would smack him in the face. “I’m fine. Check my qi yourself if you don’t believe me.”</p><p>What was a plausible excuse that would get Feng Xin to leave him alone long enough for him to calm down a bit?</p><p>“I’m just…stiff,” Mu Qing said without thinking — and promptly went bright red under his sleeve. </p><p>Oh, if only Feng Xin knew how true that was.</p><p>Feng Xin didn’t seem to notice anything wrong, though — he just took Mu Qing’s hand with a disbelieving hum. The feeling of his qi sliding through Mu Qing’s meridians did not help him calm down in the slightest, but it did seemingly satisfy Feng Xin that he had plenty of spiritual energy to spare. </p><p>Mu Qing felt the bed move as Feng Xin flopped down beside him.</p><p>“Fair enough, I guess. Pretty hypocritical of you to scold me for not fucking stretching, though.”</p><p>It didn’t take Mu Qing long to realize that with Feng Xin still here on the bed with him, radiating heat and smelling fantastic, he was very unlikely to get any less hard, so…they might as well just continue.</p><p>Mu Qing cleared his throat and shifted on the bed, sitting back upright. “A-anyway. I haven’t done your back yet. Let’s do that next.”</p><p>Feng Xin nodded. “Alright. How do you want me?” If he was aware of how the question made Mu Qing’s dick jump under his robes, his expression didn’t show it.</p><p>“On your stomach,” Mu Qing said after a moment of thought, and Feng Xin obligingly rolled over, pressing his face into Mu Qing’s pillow. He remained directly face down for a worryingly long time, but when Mu Qing hesitantly poked his arm, he turned his face to the side and sighed.</p><p>“Smells like your hair oil,” he said, sounding relaxed already. “S’nice.”</p><p>“Glad you approve,” Mu Qing said dryly.</p><p>With his fingers, he brushed Feng Xin’s hair to the side, away from his shoulders and back. While this position was almost definitely more comfortable for Feng Xin, it was going to be a bit awkward for Mu Qing to balance over him from the side — because straddling him was definitely not an option. There was no way he could look at Feng Xin’s muscled back and ass underneath him and not want to just press him into the bed and rut against him — any position that would enable him to actually <em>do</em> that was out of the question.</p><p>Mu Qing scooted up to sit a little closer beside Feng Xin’s upper back, careful not to knock his knees into his ribs, and laid a hand directly between Feng Xin’s shoulder blades. Feng Xin shuddered, but relaxed into the touch. </p><p>It was surprisingly difficult to get a steady flow of qi going — Mu Qing must have been more worked up than he realized — but once it was flowing calmly enough, Mu Qing put his other hand on Feng Xin’s back and began to press into his skin.</p><p>Like his hand and arm and chest had been, Feng Xin’s back felt full of tension. Surely it was fine if Mu Qing increased the pressure and worked out some of the knots here, too? Feng Xin had basically requested it already, after all.</p><p>He leaned his weight into his hands, starting to press and squeeze at Feng Xin’s shoulders, and was instantly rewarded with a long moan.</p><p>“Mmmm, fuuuck, I was hoping you would do that…” Feng Xin’s voice was deep and raspy, and the sound of it along with the knowledge that he’d <em>wanted</em> this sent sparks down Mu Qing’s spine. “Keep going.”</p><p>Mu Qing did keep going, working up and down Feng Xin’s spine to the tune of his gasps and groans, doing his best to ignore how each noise sent a flash of heat to his cock in favor of focusing on the way Feng Xin was melting into the bed under his touch.</p><p>“Ahh, Mu Qing, how are you — fuck — so fucking good at this?” Feng Xin gasped between the presses of Mu Qing’s hands. “You’d think, ah, that this was your — your fucking secondary domain or something.”</p><p>Mu Qing raised an eyebrow. “What, massages?” He cleared his throat and put on a snooty-sounding voice. “‘General Xuan Zhen, martial god of the Southwest and patron of masseuses’?”</p><p>Feng Xin started trembling underneath his hands. Concerned, Mu Qing nearly stopped his movements entirely — but then Feng Xin burst into loud cackles, and Mu Qing realized he’d been shaking with concealed laughter. “Hahahaha, holy fuck, it sounds ridiculous when you say it like that!”</p><p>Mu Qing knew it took very little to make Feng Xin laugh, but something warm still swelled in his chest every time it happened because of something <em>he’d</em> said — even if it wasn’t particularly funny.</p><p>Taking a deep breath to calm himself down from the laughter, Feng Xin said, “It’s probably good that you aren’t, though…then I’d have to share you.”</p><p>As if Mu Qing would ever agree to do this to anyone besides Feng Xin!</p><p>Still, the idea that Feng Xin wouldn’t want him to touch anyone else like this made warmth rise to his cheeks. “If I had to have an official secondary domain, I’d rather not have that one,” Mu Qing agreed. “The prayers would probably be unbearable.”</p><p>The curse was fully cleared from Feng Xin’s back by now, but there were still a few knots to unravel and tense muscles to loosen, so Mu Qing let himself linger, alternating between focusing on those problem spots and long, self-indulgent sweeps up and down the full length of Feng Xin’s back.</p><p>Once Mu Qing finally removed his hands, Feng Xin made a noise of discontent and rolled over to look at him, eyes half-lidded. “Done already?”</p><p>Mu Qing nodded. “Should be just your scalp left.” He slid off the bed and offered a hand to Feng Xin. “Stand up so I can check.”</p><p>“Ugh. I’m so comfy though,” Feng Xin complained, seemingly just to be contrary, because the moment after Mu Qing rolled his eyes, Feng Xin obligingly took his hand and let Mu Qing pull him up.</p><p>Walking around Feng Xin in a circle, Mu Qing inspected Feng Xin for any remaining traces of purple outside of his scalp. There were none, which was slightly disappointing, but not surprising — Mu Qing had been extremely thorough, after all.</p><p>Feng Xin’s hair was getting so long that Mu Qing had to drape it over his shoulder to see his back properly. Even before touching it, Mu Qing had been able to tell just by looking that the bath salts had dried Feng Xin’s hair out, but now that he’d felt the texture the bath salts had given it, Mu Qing was positive he wouldn’t be able to clear the curse from Feng Xin’s scalp without it becoming tangled.</p><p>Should he…offer to wash Feng Xin’s hair while he was working on the curse? </p><p>It would certainly be less painful than the inevitable tugging that would happen if he left it as it was, and Mu Qing had to admit there was a possessive part of him that thrilled at the idea of using his soap and hair oil on Feng Xin, of Feng Xin smelling like him.</p><p>Even so, the thought of suggesting it was nerve-wracking. He’d wanted to style Feng Xin’s hair before, but washing it would be much more intimate — it was something Mu Qing had never done for anyone other than his mother, not even Xie Lian.</p><p>He’d apparently been standing there staring at Feng Xin for far too long, because Feng Xin cleared his throat, looking down at his chest and arm in confusion. “What’s with that look? It looks like you got all of it to me…”</p><p>“Of course I did!” Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “I was just…thinking.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>In lieu of a response, Mu Qing grabbed Feng Xin’s hand and led him through the door to his office, and out through the back door that opened up onto his personal garden and private section of the hot springs.</p><p>Using the hot springs for hair-washing might be a little excessive, but the bathtub was still full of the bath salt-laden, purple-tinted water, and it would be a waste to drain it now since Mu Qing would need to use it later.</p><p>…And if Mu Qing had had a few fantasies about getting Feng Xin into those very hot springs in a much more romantic context — well, that was absolutely no one’s business.</p><p>“Mu Qing, what…?” Feng Xin stopped short when they entered the garden, looking around with wide eyes. “Oh, wow,” he breathed. “It’s so…fuck, it’s beautiful here.”</p><p>Mu Qing hummed, quietly pleased. This garden was another thing he didn’t share with just anyone. Unlike the other gardens at his palace, he was the only person who tended to this one, and though it was small, he was rather proud of it.</p><p>It was green and lush and covered in vines, and the canopy of trees was such that it provided decent shade during the day while still allowing an excellent view of the moon and stars at night — the latter of which Feng Xin was admiring right now, craning his neck to take everything in.</p><p>He looked ethereal in the moonlight, wearing nothing but pants, his hair still tumbling over his shoulder where Mu Qing had put it. His expression of open wonder made Mu Qing’s heart pound in his chest.</p><p>For a while, Mu Qing was content to watch Feng Xin admire the garden, but eventually his nerves couldn’t take it anymore, and he tugged Feng Xin toward the hot springs.</p><p>Feng Xin looked at the water, and then back at Mu Qing. “So, are we here to take a break, or —?”</p><p>“Hardly,” Mu Qing scoffed. “Just get in and you’ll see.”</p><p>“Clothes on or off?”</p><p>It was clearly a genuine question, his tone not flirtatious in the least, but Mu Qing flushed at it regardless. “I — why would I care! Do what you want!”</p><p>Feng Xin shrugged. “Alright then.” Then he dropped his pants in a flash and jumped into the water, causing a splash large enough to hit Mu Qing, despite how far away he stood from the edge of the water.</p><p>Sputtering, Mu Qing growled, stalking toward the water’s edge. He couldn’t tell whether he was more upset about his robes getting soaked, or the fact that Feng Xin had disrobed so quickly he’d seen barely anything more than a flash of his ass and the back of his toned thighs.</p><p>That small glimpse was still breathtaking — it was just…he had hoped for more, that was all. </p><p>It wasn’t like Mu Qing didn’t regularly see Feng Xin in various states of undress — but they hadn’t seen each other completely bare since the events of 800 years ago had necessitated bathing in relatively close proximity. </p><p>Feng Xin had filled out a lot since then, the difference between a gangly teenager and an experienced martial god clearly evident, and Mu Qing had to admit he was curious if the centuries of prayers to Ju Yang had also filled him out in…other areas — not that he’d exactly been small before.</p><p>But alas, now was apparently not the time to find out.</p><p>Mu Qing waited until Feng Xin emerged from the water, then jumped in next to him, aiming for the spot where the maximum amount of water would fly directly into Feng Xin’s face. He didn’t even bother to remove his robes — they were soaked through anyway, and it would be altogether too dangerous to wash Feng Xin’s hair like this if they were <em>both</em> naked.</p><p>Of course, the resulting wave of water made Feng Xin sputter, prompting a small splash fight — but instead of escalating into a real fight like it might have in the past, it ended abruptly when Mu Qing swept Feng Xin’s feet out from under him, and he fell beneath the water’s surface only to pop right out again, laughing wildly with his head thrown back.</p><p>Stunned, Mu Qing could do nothing but stare — at how the water droplets on his skin made him almost shine in the moonlight, at how little pieces of his hair were plastered to his face and neck, at the sheer joy in his expression and the fact that he looked like that because of <em>Mu Qing</em>.</p><p>He was so dazed that it caught him completely off guard when Feng Xin lunged forward and tackled him back into the water, taking advantage of his moment of distraction.</p><p>When they emerged, Feng Xin was still holding him — which, of course, Mu Qing could only tell by how close they were and the position of Feng Xin’s arms. Stupid fucking curse. Of course it was just his luck that this would happen when he couldn’t feel a thing.</p><p>Mu Qing slid his hands onto Feng Xin’s back just to ground himself, and he could’ve sworn that Feng Xin’s eyes grew darker at the touch.</p><p>“So,” Feng Xin said, his voice low. “Did you bring me here just to wrestle in the water or what?”</p><p>“No.” Having him so close, looking so beautiful, while being completely naked under the water was frying Mu Qing’s brain a little. “I — I thought I would. Wash your hair. While I finish removing the curse,” he said, much more honestly than he’d intended. “Do you object?”</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes widened in surprise, and he shook his head frantically. “What? No, of course not. That sounds fucking fantastic, actually,” he insisted.</p><p>His enthusiasm made Mu Qing relax a little.</p><p>“Alright.” Mu Qing attempted to swim towards the other edge of the pool to grab the basket of soaps and oils he kept out for when he decided to bathe out here, but found that he couldn’t move.</p><p>He looked down and saw that Feng Xin’s hands were still on his waist, tragically unable to feel the warmth of them.</p><p>“You’ll have to let go of me first, though,” he said dryly.</p><p>“And what if I don’t want to?”</p><p>“Then you won’t get your hair washed, I suppose.” Mu Qing shrugged like he had no investment in the outcome, and was pleased when Feng Xin grimaced and let go of him, holding his hands up in surrender.</p><p>“You drive a hard bargain,” Feng Xin said with a sigh. “Though…fuck. I guess it must be weird for you to still not be able to feel it when I touch you, huh.”</p><p>Mu Qing huffed. “You’re just realizing that now?”</p><p>“Oh, shut up. It’s not my fault you’re so fucking distracting.”</p><p>Once Mu Qing fetched the basket, he returned to Feng Xin, swimming around to stand behind him. The water only came up to a little higher than their waists when standing, but Feng Xin had sunk down far enough that most of his torso was submerged.</p><p>“Tip your head back and stay still,” Mu Qing instructed softly.</p><p>Feng Xin obeyed, and Mu Qing took a moment to smooth his wet hair away from his face.</p><p>Mu Qing’s heart stuttered when Feng Xin leaned into the touch, and he quickly distracted himself with pouring some cleanser into his palm. Then, he started up a steady stream of qi, and buried his hands in Feng Xin’s hair like he’d been wanting to for ages, slowly massaging his scalp.</p><p>Feng Xin closed his eyes and sighed in contentment. “Why are you so fucking good with your hands?” he groaned after a little while of Mu Qing working in silence.</p><p>It seemed like a rhetorical question, so Mu Qing only hummed and kept combing his fingers through Feng Xin’s hair and over his scalp. He tipped Feng Xin back a little to rinse the cleanser, then forward again so his head was no longer in the water. Feng Xin moved with him so easily it made him feel a little breathless.</p><p>Resisting the inexplicably strong urge to lean down and kiss the back of Feng Xin’s neck, Mu Qing started working his hair oil through the damp strands of Feng Xin’s hair. It was harder to see the purple of the curse out here with only the moonlight for illumination, so he felt entirely justified in taking his time, sliding his fingers through it over and over again to make sure the curse was thoroughly eliminated.</p><p>This was really…this was really so nice it almost didn’t feel real.</p><p>That Feng Xin would allow this softness without making fun of him — that he would ask for it, and enjoy it, and even freely <em>tell</em> Mu Qing that he was enjoying it — all of it felt too good to be true. </p><p>He wanted to sear every detail of this moment into his memory, just in case it all went up in smoke: the way a strange possessiveness rose within him at the peony and sandalwood scent of his hair oil on Feng Xin; the way the moon lit up Feng Xin’s features, the furrow between his brows for once nowhere in sight; the way Feng Xin felt under his hands, warm and solid and trusting.</p><p>Eventually, Mu Qing’s movements slowed, and after a long moment Feng Xin’s eyes fluttered open. Standing up, Feng Xin turned around and stepped closer, catching Mu Qing’s hands and sending a rush of heat to his face. Suddenly, Mu Qing remembered that Feng Xin was completely naked under the water and blushed even harder.</p><p>Looking like he was debating something internally, Feng Xin rubbed the back of Mu Qing’s hand with a thumb. He opened his mouth as if to say something before changing his mind and snapping it shut again.</p><p>This happened three times before Mu Qing lost his patience.</p><p>“What, have I distracted you into complete silence? Just spit it out,” Mu Qing said, rolling his eyes.</p><p>Caught, Feng Xin’s eyes widened. “Ah. I was just — do you…” He cleared his throat. “Fuck. Did you want to wait to see if the curse stays gone before I start removing yours, or…? Because if we’re starting now, I — I could wash your hair too. If you want.”</p><p>Mu Qing froze at the unexpected offer, searching Feng Xin’s face for a catch. But Feng Xin’s expression was open, if slightly flushed, and he seemed completely sincere.</p><p>It — it would hardly be efficient, since Mu Qing hadn’t used the bath salts yet — not only would Feng Xin not be able to see if he’d fully cleared the curse from Mu Qing’s scalp, Mu Qing would need to at least rinse his hair again later anyway, just to get the bath salts out. And Feng Xin had a point that it might be better to wait and see if this method of breaking the curse actually worked.</p><p>But then again — this was very likely a once in a lifetime chance, or once in a century at the very least. When would they have a reason to wash each other’s hair like this outside of the incredibly specific circumstances of this curse?</p><p>Feng Xin’s thumb rubbed against his hand again as he shifted his grip slightly, and a bolt of panic suddenly shot through Mu Qing at the thought that Feng Xin might be pulling away, that he’d missed his chance.</p><p>“A-alright,” he said quickly, clutching at Feng Xin’s fingers. “Yes. You can.”</p><p>As if Feng Xin’s touch wasn’t reward enough, he had to go and beam at Mu Qing so brightly it felt like the sun had suddenly decided to start the morning early. </p><p>“Great. Awesome.” Feng Xin pulled his hands back, and this time Mu Qing let him. “Turn around for me, then?”</p><p>Mu Qing turned. His hair was long enough that the ends of it trailed in the water even when he stood at full height, but that wouldn’t be a problem until they got to the hair oil stage, so he let himself sink into the water up to his chest like Feng Xin had, and tilted his head back.</p><p>Then he felt Feng Xin’s hands cupping the back of his head, warm and alight with his qi. Mu Qing shivered and closed his eyes, leaning into the touch — it was so good and so intense that he couldn’t help but chase the feeling.</p><p>Feng Xin breathed in, short and sharp, and began to move his fingers, and that somehow felt even better.</p><p>His movements were gentle, but firm at the same time, and Mu Qing could feel himself relaxing at a shockingly rapid pace, the tension in his spine unspooling at every slide of Feng Xin’s fingers against his scalp.</p><p>Before he knew it, he’d leaned so far back that he was mostly horizontal, floating on his back, supported by the water and Feng Xin’s hands.</p><p>His eyes fluttered open to see Feng Xin looking down at him with the softest expression he’d ever seen. Feng Xin had never looked at anyone like this, as far as he could recall — especially not at Mu Qing — and seeing it now made Mu Qing’s heart begin to race.</p><p>“Feel okay? I’m not pulling on your hair?” Feng Xin said, upon noticing Mu Qing had opened his eyes.</p><p>Mu Qing did not trust his voice at the moment. “Mm.” He closed his eyes again and let Feng Xin work at his scalp, fearing that if he looked at that tender expression for too much longer he wouldn’t be able to restrain himself from surging up and kissing Feng Xin.</p><p>Feng Xin spent a long time massaging his scalp before gently pushing at his shoulder to guide him upright, his hands still wrapped in qi so Mu Qing could feel the touch. “You gotta stand for this part. Sorry,” he said.</p><p>Feeling boneless and hazy, Mu Qing did his best to stand upright. He was too fuzzy to even feel embarrassed at how relaxed he’d gotten, though he was sure the mortification would kick in later.</p><p>Being partially out of the warm water helped him regain some clarity, and he realized that Feng Xin was already combing in the hair oil with his fingers — he must have already washed and rinsed Mu Qing’s hair while Mu Qing was floating in the hazy pleasure of Feng Xin’s hands and qi.</p><p>It didn’t take too long for Feng Xin to finish up. He walked around to face Mu Qing, draping his hair over his shoulder so that the ends didn’t get in the water. </p><p>“You good?” Feng Xin’s expression was still soft, though not as unbearably so as it had been earlier.</p><p>Mu Qing nodded. “You’re not half-bad with your hands yourself,” he said, still relaxed enough that the compliment slipped out before he could think of holding it back.</p><p>The grin he received in return was worth it. “Glad it was up to your high standards. Shall we head back in?”</p><p>Feng Xin started getting out of the water without waiting for an answer, and Mu Qing was again treated to a stunning view of his legs and ass before he put his pants back on.</p><p>The overthinking part of Mu Qing’s brain hadn’t turned back on yet, and so he let himself stare openly, a flush spreading over his face and down his neck.</p><p>…Feng Xin was truly, ridiculously, unfairly hot.</p><p>Just this brief glimpse of him was enough to make Mu Qing start to get hard again. He was acutely aware that his wet robes would not hide his arousal in the least, so he waited to get out of the water until he was sure Feng Xin wasn’t looking, and the instant he was out, he used a burst of qi to instantly dry himself and his robes.</p><p>It was wasteful, but necessary, and besides — Feng Xin would be giving him more spiritual energy soon enough.</p><p>The thought made Mu Qing feel even hotter, and he strode back toward his palace without checking if Feng Xin was following him — he needed a moment to cool down without the sight of Feng Xin’s naked torso working him right back up.</p><p>“Hey, wait up!” Feng Xin called, and jogged back to his side.</p><p>“Tch. You were taking too long,” Mu Qing huffed. “It’s already almost hai time.<a href="#footnote3" name="return3" title="click to see footnote" rel="nofollow" id="return3"><sup>[1]</sup></a> If you want to sleep at your normal old-man bedtime we’ll have to hurry it up.”</p><p>“Fuck you, you’re older than me!”</p><p>“Only by a month. And just because I’m older doesn’t make you any less of an old man.”</p><p>“We’re old men together, then,” Feng Xin snorted. “When you say hurry it up…does that mean you want to keep going? You don’t want to wait and see if the cure is permanent?”</p><p>Mu Qing flushed. “If you want to wait, then we can wait. But…I’m fine to keep going.”</p><p>They’d reached Mu Qing’s bedchambers, and Feng Xin pinned Mu Qing with an intense look, closing the door to the office behind him. “Then let’s fucking break this curse. On the bed again?”</p><p>“…That’s fine,” Mu Qing said stiffly, his blush still going strong. “I’ll have to get in the bath first though. You should…” What could he send Feng Xin to do that would get him out of the room for a moment so Mu Qing could calm down a little? “You should go get something to drink from my storerooms, and I’ll get changed.”</p><p>For some reason, Feng Xin’s face went a little red. “Good idea! I’ll…I’ll just do that then.” He rushed out of the room, not even bothering to put on his inner robes first.</p><p>…At least he was still wearing pants. Hopefully Mu Qing’s deputies wouldn’t be too scandalized to see him wandering around the palace shirtless.</p>

  <p>The heating talismans on the bath had worn off and the water had gone cold, but Mu Qing didn’t bother to add more of them before stripping efficiently and sinking briefly under the surface of the dyed water. It was fine to be a little cold for the moment — he’d be overheating as soon as Feng Xin put his hands on him anyway, and the cool water helped to finally get his heart rate under control.</p><p>After emerging, he put on fresh pants and inner robes, and dried his hair with another burst of spiritual energy. He’d kept most of the length of his hair out of the water so as not to fully ruin Feng Xin’s efforts, but near his scalp the dye had still made it feel kind of strange — a bit dry, like Feng Xin’s had been, but also with a weirdly wavy texture.</p><p>Whatever. It wasn’t like Feng Xin would notice or care that his hair wasn’t as soft as usual.</p><p>It felt like Feng Xin took forever to return, and when he finally did re-enter the room, he looked even more flustered than before. He had a pitcher and two cups with him, so it seemed like he did manage to get something to drink at least.</p><p>“Did my deputies give you a hard time?” Mu Qing asked, amused.</p><p>“Hah. You could say that…”</p><p>Feng Xin did not elaborate, but he did pour them each a cup from the pitcher, and handed one to Mu Qing where he sat on the bed, legs tucked to one side.</p><p>Mu Qing took a sip, then raised his eyebrows, surprised. It wasn’t wine, as he’d half expected, but pomegranate juice — one of Mu Qing’s favorites. He wondered what Feng Xin had said to his deputies for them to allow him to take some from his storeroom — it wasn’t something they’d usually share with anyone outside the palace.</p><p>“Good choice,” he said, tipping his cup in Feng Xin’s direction.</p><p>Feng Xin beamed in response. “Thought it’d go with the whole purple aesthetic you have going.”</p><p>“Ugh, don’t remind me. How bad is it?”</p><p>“Not too bad. Way fucking lighter on you than it was on me,” Feng Xin said cheerfully. “I bet you didn’t spend more than a few seconds under the water.”</p><p>It was true. “Why you didn’t do the same will forever be a mystery to me.”</p><p>“What can I say, the temptation to soak in a warm bath is strong.” Feng Xin set his cup aside and settled himself back onto the bed, cross-legged in front of Mu Qing. “Ready for me to do your face?”</p><p>Mu Qing swallowed, throat feeling dry despite the juice he’d just consumed. “I suppose there’s no point in delaying it. Go on then.”</p><p>Should Mu Qing…close his eyes for this? It was tempting, if only so he wouldn’t be overwhelmed by seeing Feng Xin dedicate all his focus towards him (not to mention that Feng Xin was still shirtless)…but then again, if Mu Qing had to blindly anticipate where Feng Xin’s hands would land next, it would likely be hard to control his reactions, and he’d be jumpy the entire time.</p><p>Probably better to keep his eyes open, then.</p><p>Mu Qing was immediately rewarded for that decision with the sight of Feng Xin’s expression of concentration — brows furrowed and eyes focused as he settled his hands onto Mu Qing’s skin. It was unfairly cute.</p><p>Even before Feng Xin started up his qi, Mu Qing shivered in anticipation as Feng Xin’s hands came to rest against the side of his neck, and the heat of Feng Xin’s spiritual energy a few moments later felt even better than he'd thought it would, sinking into his skin and intertwining with Mu Qing’s own qi.</p><p>The intimacy of it was driving Mu Qing insane — qi transfers didn’t usually feel like this, did they? Maybe the simmering state of arousal he’d been in all night was starting to affect not just Mu Qing himself, but how their qi interacted, too.</p><p>Starting with his collarbones and neck, Feng Xin moved his fingers against Mu Qing’s skin, moving slowly upward. Mu Qing’s neck was rather sensitive, and the way Feng Xin caressed it with just the right amount of pressure had him feeling like he’d melt into a puddle at any moment. </p><p>Fuck. Feng Xin had barely started and Mu Qing already felt like he was falling apart.</p><p>Trying to ground himself by focusing on Feng Xin didn’t help in the least — his eyes just kept dropping to Feng Xin’s lips without his permission. Maybe he should have closed them after all.</p><p>Then, Feng Xin’s thumbs slid over Mu Qing’s jawline, right under his ears — and before he could stop it, a small, breathy noise escaped Mu Qing’s throat.</p><p>“Ah…”</p><p>Immediately, his face heated in embarrassment.</p><p>Feng Xin seemed to take it in stride, though — maybe Mu Qing’s blush wasn’t even visible under the purple of the curse. “Sorry — was that ticklish? I can try to touch a little less lightly.” </p><p>He kept working, moving up over Mu Qing’s jaw and chin. Even though Mu Qing knew it was coming, the first touch of his fingers against Mu Qing’s lips almost made him let out another gasp.</p><p>The drag of Feng Xin's thumb against his mouth felt electric. Fuck. Mu Qing wanted to kiss him so badly — it took everything he had to keep his lips still while Feng Xin worked. </p><p>After what felt like ages, Feng Xin finally finished clearing the curse from his mouth. “Not — not ticklish,” Mu Qing managed, once his fingers moved away, sounding slightly strangled. “Just…hurry up.” </p><p>It was going to feel intense regardless of how Feng Xin touched him, he was sure, and he could feel his self-control fraying by the second.</p><p>“I’m going as fast as I can without fucking blasting you in the face with my qi,” Feng Xin grumbled. “I’m really not used to this level of fine control. Usually the blasting is the whole point, so I don’t exactly have a lot of practice holding back.”</p><p>Honestly, Mu Qing never would have guessed this didn’t come naturally to Feng Xin. It had felt so good when he cleared the curse from Mu Qing’s hands and scalp earlier, and even now he was doing an impressive job of keeping the flow of spiritual energy slow and steady. His qi felt downright calm, especially in comparison to Mu Qing’s qi, which was flowing a little wildly, matching his pounding heartbeat.</p><p>“I couldn’t tell,” Mu Qing said. He meant to be sincere, but unfortunately, his voice was so used to sarcastic tones that the sincerity was completely lost in transit.</p><p>Feng Xin scowled. “No need to be rude about it. I really am doing my best, I swear,” he insisted. He caressed Mu Qing’s cheekbones with both thumbs, then tapped them lightly, his expression shifting back to intense concentration. “Close your eyes.”</p><p>With his eyes closed, Mu Qing found it easier to speak directly, somehow. “I…didn’t intend that to be sarcastic. I truly couldn’t tell,” he said softly.</p><p>“…Really?” Feng Xin’s fingertips seemed extra gentle as they swept beneath his eyes, then over his eyelids.</p><p>“Really. I’ve had less controlled energy transfers from the medical gods, and that’s half their fucking job. You’re doing fine. It feels…” Mu Qing paused, feeling a blush rise to his cheeks again. “…It feels good,” he finally admitted.</p><p>Feng Xin made a strange noise, seemingly struck speechless. “…Good,” he said, after a long moment. His voice was deeper and rougher than usual, and Mu Qing felt hot at the sound of it. “Good. That’s good. …Alright, you can open your eyes now. Almost done.” He smoothed his thumbs over Mu Qing’s forehead, then abruptly said, “Why are your eyelashes so fucking long, anyway?”</p><p>“I don’t know, why are your eyebrows so fucking thick?” Mu Qing countered. “They just grow that way, it’s not like I have any control over it.”</p><p>“I mean, you could? Control it, I mean. Other gods do — pretty sure Pei Ming’s given himself those beauty marks on purpose. If the prayers I get are anything to go by, women love that shit.”</p><p>“Are you saying I should, what, make my eyelashes a more normal length, then?” Mu Qing said, amused. “To attract <em>women</em>?” </p><p>“No! I just…” Feng Xin trailed off, mumbling something Mu Qing couldn’t quite catch.</p><p>“You just what?”</p><p>“I said, I just could have sworn they weren’t that long when we were young!” he burst out, a bit too loudly this time for how close he’d leaned to Mu Qing’s ear to clear away the curse there.</p><p>…Mu Qing hadn’t realized Feng Xin had even been looking, back then. Or ever, really. He would have expected right now to be the only exception, since Feng Xin basically had no choice but to examine him in detail — so the fact that Feng Xin had noticed a tiny thing like that all those years ago made something warm rise up in Mu Qing’s chest.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you paid such close attention to my eyelashes.”</p><p>“Oh, shut the fuck up,” Feng Xin groused. His cheeks were a bit red. “Just turn your damn face so I can do your other ear.”</p><p>Without the distraction of conversation, it was hard not to shiver at Feng Xin’s fingertips skimming over his ears — was it the qi making it feel so intense, or were his ears just that sensitive?</p><p>Then Feng Xin started absently stroking the side of his neck with one hand while sifting through his hair with the other, checking that his scalp was fully clear of the curse, and shivers went down Mu Qing’s spine, making his breath quicken. </p><p>Fuck. It didn’t seem to matter how or where Feng Xin was touching him — all of it felt so overwhelmingly good, his skin so sensitive, so attuned to Feng Xin’s every move. </p><p>Mu Qing never wanted him to stop. </p><p>Of course, the instant he had that thought, Feng Xin pulled his hands away, finished with Mu Qing’s scalp, and Mu Qing nearly let out a noise of displeasure, fighting the urge to chase the touch. </p><p>“Should I…do your arms next? Are you okay to keep going?” Feng Xin asked, his eyebrows furrowed in concern. “Your face is…really flushed.”</p><p>Ah. Now that the purple of the curse was gone, there was nothing to hide how easily Mu Qing blushed at Feng Xin’s touch. </p><p>“That’s…fine,” Mu Qing said. It came out more breathless than he’d intended.</p><p>His mind was too hazy from all the touches to think of a good excuse for the blush, so he opted to just ignore that comment, and slid off the bed to remove his inner robes, folding them neatly before returning to sit in front of Feng Xin and holding out his arms. He honestly just wanted Feng Xin’s hands back on him as soon as possible. </p><p>Feng Xin seemed surprised at his eagerness, but didn’t comment — he just scooted closer to Mu Qing and started running his hands over Mu Qing’s forearms with that same cute look of intense concentration.</p><p>Apparently, the inside of Mu Qing’s forearms and elbows were almost as sensitive as his neck — Feng Xin’s fingers trailing over the skin there sent shivers down his spine, and it took an immense amount of effort not to make another embarrassing noise.</p><p>He was so focused on keeping his breathing even that it took him by surprise when Feng Xin suddenly squeezed his upper arms while working his way up.</p><p>“…What was that for?” Mu Qing asked. His voice came out a little hoarse despite his efforts to keep it steady.</p><p>Feng Xin startled and let go of Mu Qing’s arms. “Ah—! Sorry, I didn’t mean to —” He laughed a little awkwardly. “It’s just that — well, your robes are always so loose and flowy. I kind of forget that you’re fucking built under all that fabric.”</p><p>“Good,” Mu Qing said. When Feng Xin looked at him in confusion, he clarified, “Good that you forget, I mean. That’s the idea. If I don’t look like a typical martial god, people underestimate my strength. It can be a surprisingly large advantage in a fight.” </p><p>He’d always enjoyed the scholarly aesthetic for its elegance, but it was definitely an added bonus that it led people to assume he was thin and frail, when he was really all lean muscle.</p><p>“Well, it suits me just fine that no one else knows you look this fucking good under your robes.”</p><p>Mu Qing looked at him questioningly.</p><p>“Come on, you know what I mean.” Feng Xin’s face twisted into a strange expression. “Every new heavenly official already fucking flirts with you as soon as they meet you, at least until you open your mouth. And some of them aren’t even that put off by your attitude. You’d never get a moment’s rest if they saw you looking like this.”</p><p>It wasn’t that Mu Qing didn’t notice when the new arrivals paid him compliments or tried to follow him around, but he’d always assumed they were just trying to butter him up and get into his good graces since he was one of the most powerful gods. It never occurred to Mu Qing that they were after anything more than their own political gain — especially since they usually stopped after he snapped at them, or once they found out he wasn’t particularly well-liked amongst the other gods.</p><p>…Flirting? Really? It was hard to believe.</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “And how exactly do I look, then?” The sarcastic quip came out automatically, before he could really process what he was asking.</p><p>With no hesitation, Feng Xin said, “Beautiful.”</p><p>Mu Qing’s eyes went wide.</p><p>Then Feng Xin put his hands back on Mu Qing’s arms where he’d left off with the curse, and Mu Qing’s mind immediately blanked, unable to process the compliment, or any rational thought at all, other than how fucking amazing Feng Xin’s hands felt against him.</p><p>Something about the way Feng Xin touched him had changed — it was somehow even more intense than before, heavy and possessive, and Feng Xin’s gaze stayed on Mu Qing’s face now, rather than focusing on the movement of his hands, his eyes dark and full of intent.</p><p>Mu Qing couldn’t look away.</p><p>He’d been half-hard from the moment Feng Xin first touched him, but this change in Feng Xin’s mood was rapidly bringing him to full hardness, and it was getting even more difficult to control his breathing.</p><p>Slowly, Feng Xin moved up Mu Qing’s arms, pressing against him until all the purple was gone and his hands finally rested on Mu Qing’s shoulders. For a moment, Feng Xin just looked at him, searching Mu Qing’s face for — something. Mu Qing could have sworn Feng Xin’s eyes dropped to his lips for an instant, but they flicked up again so quickly that he couldn’t be sure he didn’t just imagine it.</p><p>“…Can I do your back?” Feng Xin asked after a moment, voice low and rough.</p><p>As he spoke, he brushed his thumb against Mu Qing’s neck and reached up to cup his jaw, sending a shiver down his spine.</p><p>Mu Qing was helpless to do anything but nod, breathless and incredibly turned on.</p><p>Even as he shuffled around to sit behind Mu Qing, Feng Xin’s hands never left his skin, like he was just as reluctant to break the contact between them as Mu Qing was.</p><p>Feng Xin made a considering noise before tracing the center of his back, the touch of his qi more unsteady than before. “Fuck, the curse really is much stronger here,” he said darkly. “I don’t think I’ll ever forget the sight of her arm going right through you.”</p><p>Mu Qing swallowed. “It was certainly unpleasant,” he admitted. “But I’m fine. The curse will be gone tonight and it’ll be like it never happened, so you can stop thinking about it so much.”</p><p>“Rich of you to be telling <em>me</em> to stop overthinking,” Feng Xin huffed. “It’s hard not to think about it when I’m looking right at it.”</p><p>Suddenly, Feng Xin’s qi surged, sending a rush of energy into Mu Qing’s chest and a wave of heat throughout his body. “Ah!” he gasped, reeling at the intensity of it. “What— ngh, what are you doing?”</p><p>“Making sure there’s not a single speck of this curse left where she touched you,” Feng Xin growled, and sent another pulse of qi into him, seemingly unintentionally. Mu Qing shuddered. It felt so good, so shockingly intimate, like Feng Xin was claiming him from the inside out.</p><p>“Is this okay?” Feng Xin asked softly. He was so close to Mu Qing that his breath tickled against his ear.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Mu Qing said, rendered breathless once again under the intensity of Feng Xin’s touch.</p><p>Feng Xin hummed, sounding pleased. “Tell me if you want me to stop.”</p><p><em>I won’t ever want you to stop</em>.</p><p>Warm hands worked their way up and down Mu Qing’s spine, pressing at his shoulder blades, at his hips, massaging at his sides. It felt incredible. Mu Qing could feel his body loosening for Feng Xin, relaxing into his touch, and Feng Xin responded by leaning more of his weight into his hands, occasionally sending little pulses of qi that made Mu Qing’s cock throb in his pants. Fuck, if Feng Xin kept going like this…</p><p>“Ah,” Mu Qing gasped again, when Feng Xin’s thumbs began to massage his lower back. “That’s…oh, fuck.”  </p><p>“Still can’t believe you were getting on my case about stretching when you’re this fucking tense,” Feng Xin said, sounding slightly breathless himself.</p><p>Mu Qing wanted to return the banter, but Feng Xin’s fingers pressed into a particularly stubborn knot and he lost all capacity for coherent speech. “Hnnngh.”</p><p>He felt Feng Xin huff a shaky laugh against his ear and realized he’d leaned back so far that his head was resting against Feng Xin’s shoulder.</p><p>“We really should’ve been doing this ages ago, huh,” Feng Xin mused after a while, still sounding breathless and unsteady. Distantly, Mu Qing felt a swell of satisfaction that he wasn’t the only one affected. “If only I’d known this was the best way to get you to stop arguing with me.”</p><p>If only they had been doing this the whole time. Mu Qing could hardly imagine being so lucky.</p><p>“Mmmm…fuck. Yeah,” he slurred in agreement, letting himself slump even further back against Feng Xin’s hands. “S’nice…”</p><p>Unwinding 800 years worth of tension felt so good he could practically float away with the pleasure. He was distantly aware that he was so hard he was probably leaking through his pants, but all that mattered in that moment was the delicious pressure of Feng Xin’s hands on his back and Feng Xin’s qi filling his meridians with heat.</p><p>“Yeah?” Feng Xin said, his voice husky. “Tell me…tell me what you like about it.”</p><p>“Your — nngh…your hands,” Mu Qing moaned, too lost in the pleasure to be self-conscious anymore. “So warm…feels like I’m — melting…mmmnh, don’t stop…”</p><p>“I won’t stop.”</p><p>Feng Xin worked Mu Qing’s back until he was gasping and limp against him, their bodies so close that Mu Qing would’ve been pressed against Feng Xin’s chest, were Feng Xin’s hands not in the way.</p><p>“Can I…?” Feng Xin murmured, sliding a hand around to massage at Mu Qing’s chest.</p><p>“Ah—!” When Feng Xin’s hand brushed against his nipple, Mu Qing startled at the shock of heat that went directly to his cock, and his hips jumped involuntarily. “Please…”</p><p>“Fuck, Mu Qing, you’re so —” Feng Xin groaned, and pulled Mu Qing tighter against him, folding his legs out so that his thighs cradled Mu Qing’s hips.</p><p>The flow of Feng Xin’s spiritual energy felt a little unsteady, pulsing in time with each press of his hands, but it was still removing the curse, the purple steadily disappearing from Mu Qing’s chest, and despite (or perhaps because of) the lapse of control, it felt even better than the steady trickle from earlier.</p><p>In fact, it felt so insanely good that if Mu Qing thought if he just let his own qi rise up to meet Feng Xin’s and match its rhythm, it would feel a lot like how he’d imagined dual cultivation to be. Even the thought of it sent a wave of arousal through him, and without him even trying, Mu Qing’s qi surged up, sliding against Feng Xin’s qi inside him and up into Feng Xin’s body through every place they were connected skin-to-skin.</p><p>“Ah—!” Feng Xin gasped, and clutched him tighter. “Oh, fuck…how are you — how are you doing that?” Despite his question, his qi began to match the movement of Mu Qing’s, making Mu Qing gasp in turn.</p><p>The slide of Feng Xin’s hands against his chest was driving him crazy, and he couldn’t help pressing up into the touch with a moan. Heat was starting to coil tighter and tighter in his abdomen, and he reached up to cover Feng Xin’s hands with his own, not sure whether he meant to press them harder against his chest or simply to ensure they stayed where they were. “Feng Xin, ahhh—”</p><p>Unexpectedly, Feng Xin froze at the sound of his name — then suddenly pulled his hands out from under Mu Qing’s.</p><p>“Wh-what’s wrong—?”</p><p>“Mu Qing, I —”</p><p>They both started talking over each other at once, Mu Qing feeling dazed from the sudden disappearance of Feng Xin’s hands, and Feng Xin sounding slightly panicked.</p><p>Mu Qing waved his hand for Feng Xin to go ahead, and attempted to maneuver himself into a position where he could see Feng Xin’s face without losing all contact between them, trying to stave off the cold dread that wanted to worm its way into his ribcage.</p><p>“Fuck, I’m so sorry, Mu Qing, I completely forgot,” Feng Xin said, a hand covering his face. Then he looked up at Mu Qing, eyebrows furrowed. “I — fuck, about your cultivation? Is this even okay? I didn’t — I don’t want you to lose everything just because I can’t fucking keep my hands to—”</p><p>Ah. So that’s all it was.</p><p>The relief was so overwhelming that Mu Qing nearly laughed out loud. He raised a hand and covered Feng Xin’s mouth with his palm to stop his rambling.</p><p>This turned out to be a mistake, as he immediately became distracted by the feeling of Feng Xin’s lips against his hand, but it thankfully only took him a moment to remember what he had meant to say.</p><p>“It’s fine,” Mu Qing said, dropping his hand from Feng Xin’s face. “I already decided to change my cultivation after Jun Wu used that stupid sword on Xie Lian. I didn’t have time to cultivate a new path immediately, but after Tonglu there was plenty of time. So…it’s not an issue.”</p><p>He watched as Feng Xin’s eyes went wide with the realization — Mu Qing had already been completely out of spiritual energy after the fight with Jun Wu, so it had been a perfect opportunity to change his cultivation method with no one being any the wiser.</p><p>“Now, will you get on with it already?” To emphasize his point, Mu Qing lay back against Feng Xin’s chest again, took Feng Xin’s hands into his, and guided them back to his chest.</p><p>Feng Xin sighed, relieved, and wrapped his arms fully around Mu Qing’s waist to pull him even closer. “Fuck, I should’ve known you’d already thought about it.”</p><p>Mu Qing thought he felt a light pressure against his hair. “Yes, you should have.”</p><p>“…Was it really <em>only</em> because of that creepy sword, though?” said Feng Xin, his voice light and teasing.</p><p>He’d started running his hands all over Mu Qing’s body again, sending those pulsing waves of spiritual energy into him and sliding further downward, over his ribs and caressing his sides.</p><p>It was highly distracting. Mu Qing felt a blush rising to his face, both because of the question and his quickly returning arousal.</p><p>Honestly, the only reason he hadn’t changed his path sooner was that he’d never had an excuse to do so until the virginity sword incident — and even that was an awfully flimsy excuse. It wasn’t like his virginity was some big secret. </p><p>If pressed, he would have said that if he ever decided to break his cultivation vows and the sword was used on him, people would know he was weaker — if only temporarily — and take advantage of that weakness. Changing his cultivation method in advance would simply ensure that people would underestimate him, if that situation ever came to pass.</p><p>After all, he could hardly just tell people that the real reason he’d wanted to do away with his outdated vows was nothing but a tiny, unfounded sliver of hope that Feng Xin might somehow, someday be interested in him. And a simpler excuse — like claiming he’d suddenly had an overwhelming desire to start drinking regularly — would just make people think he’d gone insane.</p><p>Apparently, he’d been quiet for too long, because Feng Xin squeezed at his chest again and said, “Tell me. …Please.”</p><p>Fuck. Mu Qing was apparently embarrassingly weak to Feng Xin asking him anything all breathily like that. “…Obviously it, haahh, wasn’t only the sword,” he grit out between moans. “Otherwise I wouldn’t have let this get this far — ahh!”</p><p>Mu Qing was getting so close, just from Feng Xin’s hands on his chest and the hot press of his body behind him. Their qi had begun to pulse together feverishly again, without Mu Qing’s conscious input, and it was so intoxicating to feel Feng Xin everywhere — on him, around him, inside him — so desperately, electrically good.</p><p>“Fuck, Mu Qing,” Feng Xin gasped into his ear. “Was it…was it because you’d been wanting to do this with — ah, f-fuck — with me?”</p><p>Normally, Mu Qing would have snapped that that should have been obvious, of course it was him, idiot — or something of that nature — but he was too far gone now for anything but raw honesty.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>, Feng Xin, I — ah! Fuck, I — only, <em>ngh</em>, only with you —”</p><p>Several things happened at once: one of Feng Xin’s hands pulled Mu Qing tight against him, while the other hand slid down Mu Qing’s bare stomach, rough fingers grazing just underneath the waistline of his pants, his qi suddenly surging and flooding Mu Qing with heat; Feng Xin let out a cracked, desperate moan, then ducked his head down to bite at Mu Qing’s neck like he was laying a claim, the sensations of his hands and mouth and voice and the heat of his body all combining to flood Mu Qing with pleasure — and then —</p><p>“Nnnn, Feng Xin, I’m — haah…<em>ahhh!</em>”</p><p>— the heat in his stomach wound so tight that it snapped, and Mu Qing was coming with a loud moan, so hard that his back arched and his vision went spotty.</p><p>Dazed, he collapsed back against Feng Xin, who was breathing hard, his hips twitching against Mu Qing’s back in small thrusts.</p><p>Feng Xin clutched Mu Qing tighter against him and gasped into his neck. “Did you just…? Ohhh fuck Mu Qing, that’s so fucking hot, fuck…” He kissed Mu Qing’s neck desperately, sending little aftershocks of pleasure through him, and a hand reached down to touch the growing wet spot on Mu Qing’s pants. “Oh my god, oh fuck, you’re so — I can’t believe you — all for me, ahh —”</p><p>Though Mu Qing couldn’t feel Feng Xin’s hand against his softening cock — truly, fuck this curse — the visual of it along with Feng Xin’s lips on his neck sent a flash of heat through him, even though he’d just come, and he weakly bucked his hips up against Feng Xin’s palm.</p><p>Feng Xin gasped, hips moving frantically, letting out a strangled noise against Mu Qing’s neck. “Hhhn — oh fuck, <em>Mu Qing</em> —” Then he went tense as a bowstring, and his hips stuttered against Mu Qing’s back as he came, panting hard into Mu Qing’s ear and clutching him so tight against his chest it was nearly painful.</p><p>Suddenly, Mu Qing understood why Feng Xin had been so affected by his swift orgasm — the idea that Feng Xin had come from so little, without being directly touched — that Mu Qing had <em>made</em> him come so quickly — it sent a rush of emotion and arousal through him, and he suddenly <em>needed</em> to have Feng Xin in his arms, to hold him —</p><p>Once Feng Xin’s grip on him loosened a bit, he awkwardly pulled himself upright and turned around so he could sit in Feng Xin’s lap — as best he could while being unable to feel Feng Xin against his legs.</p><p>A wave of uncertainty hit him when Feng Xin didn’t immediately pull him close again, and he paused, studying Feng Xin’s expression for any sign that this was unwelcome. His eyes were still closed and he was slumped back against the headboard, panting lightly — still recovering from his orgasm, it seemed.</p><p>Mu Qing breathed a sigh of relief. Waiting for Feng Xin to return to reality, he looped an arm around his neck, and gave in to the impulse to stroke his hair back from his face — something he wasn’t sure he’d be brave enough to do if Feng Xin was looking at him.</p><p>Slowly, Feng Xin’s eyes cracked open. He still looked far away for a moment, but as soon as his eyes focused on Mu Qing, a smile so bright Mu Qing felt almost blinded appeared on his face, and his hands went directly to Mu Qing’s waist.</p><p>“Hi,” he said. His voice sounded absolutely wrecked.</p><p>“Hi,” Mu Qing replied. “Are you…doing alright?”</p><p>“Hm? Yeah, why?”</p><p>“It seemed like you were out of it for a long time.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s grin got even wider. “Well, yeah — that’s ‘cause you fucked my brains out. Takes a while to recover from that, you know.”</p><p>Mu Qing bit back the instinctive ‘I wouldn’t know’ — because, well, he did know now. He’d probably taken just as long to recover as Feng Xin — it was just hard to tell when all he could remember after his orgasm was how Feng Xin had sounded when he fell apart behind him.</p><p>“Not hard to have the brains fucked out of you when you have so little to begin with,” he said. It came out sounding entirely too fond for the insult it was intended to be.</p><p>If his expression was anything to go by, Feng Xin didn’t take it as an insult at all, just looked at him with an inexplicable softness in his eyes. He reached up to cup Mu Qing’s face, and Mu Qing let himself be drawn closer until they were nose-to-nose.</p><p>“I can’t believe I still haven’t kissed you,” Feng Xin whispered, eyes dropping to Mu Qing’s lips.</p><p>“Hmm. There’s an easy way to fix that.”</p><p>Mu Qing didn’t wait for Feng Xin’s reply before leaning in and connecting their lips, softly at first, then with increasing intensity as they both tried to pull each other closer.</p><p>Fuck. Kissing Feng Xin was even better than Mu Qing had imagined, the push and pull of it coming just as naturally as fighting at each other’s sides. </p><p>It was thrilling, the way Feng Xin matched Mu Qing’s enthusiasm, messy and desperate and clutching at Mu Qing’s back — Mu Qing couldn’t get enough of it. He squirmed, trying to adjust his position on Feng Xin’s lap so that he could press their chests together while they kissed, eager for more skin-to-skin contact.</p><p>Distracted by Feng Xin’s mouth, and with his legs still affected by the curse, Mu Qing didn’t realize his movements were a bit <em>too</em> eager until Feng Xin suddenly broke the kiss and let out a grunt that sounded more pained than pleasured.</p><p>“What? What happened?” Mu Qing asked, alarmed.</p><p>The pain on Feng Xin’s face cleared away quickly, and to Mu Qing’s surprise he started laughing. “Hahaha, it’s just — your pointy-ass knee dug into my thigh there for a second.” He grinned at Mu Qing. “I’d say I couldn’t believe we got distracted enough to completely forget about the curse, but…well. You <em>are</em> pretty fucking distracting.”</p><p>Now that Feng Xin pointed it out, the inability to feel Feng Xin under his legs as he sat on his lap was suddenly extremely disconcerting again — not to mention that the dampness in his pants was getting quite uncomfortable. It certainly said something about Feng Xin’s kissing skill that it was enough to make Mu Qing disregard every other sensation, or lack thereof…or maybe it only said something about how absolutely gone Mu Qing was for Feng Xin.</p><p>Mu Qing sighed. “We should probably clean up. And then finish dealing with the curse.” He pulled back, but couldn’t bring himself to actually try to leave Feng Xin’s lap just yet, leaving his arms draped around Feng Xin’s neck.</p><p>“Mm, we should,” Feng Xin agreed, but also made no move to let go of Mu Qing.</p><p>“…That means you have to let me get up.” Mu Qing said, exasperated, despite the fact that Feng Xin wasn’t exactly holding Mu Qing down against his will.</p><p>“Mm. Too comfy.”</p><p>With neither willing to let go first, they sat there holding each other in a self-imposed stalemate for a while longer — until Mu Qing truly couldn’t bear the stickiness anymore, and he finally disentangled himself from Feng Xin — careful about where he was putting his legs this time — and rose from the bed to get some damp cloths.</p><p>“Hurry up and get undressed and clean off. The sooner we get this curse removed the sooner we can —” Mu Qing cut himself off, suddenly uncertain.</p><p>Just because he was eager to keep holding Feng Xin and touching him and kissing him after the curse was gone — eager to let their bodies intertwine once they could feel <em>all</em> of each other — didn’t mean that Feng Xin wanted more, too.</p><p>What exactly was all this for Feng Xin, anyway? Was his heart also aching from the tenderness of it all, or was it only physical for him? Sure, they had kissed, but other people — people who weren’t Mu Qing — kissed people they weren’t in love with all the time, and Mu Qing didn’t know if he could handle it if this turned out to be nothing more than a one-time fling for Feng Xin.</p><p>Feng Xin’s expression did something strange, further increasing Mu Qing’s uncertainty. “The sooner we can — what?”</p><p>He sounded…upset? Confused? Whatever it was, it certainly wasn’t excitement at the prospect of being able to keep touching each other after the curse was gone without anything else getting in the way, and Mu Qing’s heart dropped.</p><p>“N-never mind. It doesn’t matter,” Mu Qing said, holding his voice purposefully steady and walking away from the bed. “Anyway, the curse won’t stay gone forever, so we shouldn’t dawdle unless you want to have to start over again from the beginning.”</p><p>Mu Qing dipped a couple of spare cloths into the small fountain that supplied fresh water in the corner of his room and wrung them out — then he threw one of them over his shoulder at Feng Xin before dropping his own pants to start wiping away the cum with the other.</p><p>“Hey, I’m not the one who would apparently mind it if we had to start ov— ngh!” Feng Xin let out a strangled noise.</p><p>Mu Qing, still facing away from Feng Xin, looked over his shoulder at him with a raised eyebrow. Had he somehow smacked Feng Xin in the face with the cloth without even aiming?</p><p>“A-ah. That’s — yeah. Fuck. Fine,” Feng Xin croaked, somewhat nonsensically, and picked up the cloth from where it had landed on the bed.</p><p>Despite the temptation to watch while Feng Xin cleaned himself off, Mu Qing forced himself to turn around again — but even if he didn’t look, the rustling noises coming from the bed made it difficult not to at least imagine Feng Xin slipping his pants down to wipe away the cum, shucking them off so he was fully bare.</p><p>Fully bare — in Mu Qing’s bed.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Sometimes it really felt like everything about this curse was made to torture Mu Qing, specifically.</p><p>Despite the heat reigniting within Mu Qing at the thought of Feng Xin naked in his bed, the sweat was still cooling rapidly on his body now that he was no longer touching Feng Xin, so before heading back to the bed, he put his inner robe back on — though he decided to leave it hanging open at the front. It somehow felt more alluring like that than either pulling it closed or staying completely naked.</p><p>Then he poured another cup of pomegranate juice for each of them, taking a large gulp from his own cup in hopes that it would help steady his shaking hands, and turned back to the bed.</p><p>Feng Xin apparently hadn’t had the same desire to cover up — he was lounging back against the pillows in all his naked glory, laid out like a prize for Mu Qing to come and claim, and Mu Qing no longer had the willpower to keep himself from staring.</p><p>God. He was so beautiful.</p><p>Was this why Feng Xin never cared much about the accuracy of his statues? Mu Qing’s worshippers would never dare to carve him in a position like this, but Feng Xin’s…definitely might, if they were ever allowed to see how blisteringly hot he truly was. Feng Xin was already so embarrassed by the Ju Yang title; he might just burst into flames if his followers decided to start worshiping him in such a way.</p><p>Speaking of Ju Yang…</p><p>It seemed that the rumors were slightly exaggerated — but not by much. Feng Xin’s cock was no third leg, but it was on the large side for his stature, and it was already half-hard again, leaking slightly at the tip. Mu Qing’s lips parted involuntarily.</p><p>Fuck, he really wanted to put his mouth on it.</p><p>Feng Xin huffed a small laugh. “See something you like?”</p><p>Mu Qing’s eyes snapped up, startled out of his reverie.</p><p>Feng Xin was smirking, but his gaze was heated, and his own eyes seemed unable to resist looking Mu Qing up and down in long, slow sweeps.</p><p>“Hmph. I could ask you the same,” Mu Qing said, flushing deeply. Then he slid onto the bed and handed Feng Xin the second cup of juice.</p><p>Feng Xin accepted the cup with a surprised raise of his eyebrows, then promptly downed the whole thing in one go, throat working as he swallowed.</p><p>A small drop of juice escaped the corner of his mouth, sliding down his chin towards his neck, and the urge to lean forward and lick it away and then kiss him breathless was so strong Mu Qing almost tipped forward face-first onto the bed with the force of it.</p><p>Instead, he weakly said, “You have —” and then pointed to his own chin.</p><p>“Ah — thanks.” Feng Xin wiped away the drop with the back of his hand and set the cup onto the bedside table. His lips were stained a darker red from the deep color of the pomegranate juice. “I was pretty thirsty.”</p><p>…He was trying to kill Mu Qing. Seduce him to death — or something. Mu Qing was sure of it.</p><p>Groaning inwardly, Mu Qing let himself fall back onto his elbows, laying upside down on the bed so his head was near the foot of it. Unceremoniously, he plopped a purple-tinted leg across Feng Xin’s thighs. It looked like his toes were nearly brushing Feng Xin’s hip, but at this angle he couldn’t quite tell if they actually made contact, since he couldn’t feel Feng Xin against him.</p><p>Feng Xin made a small noise, his gaze dropping to where they touched. He put a hand on Mu Qing’s leg, but didn’t start up his qi yet, so Mu Qing couldn’t feel that either.</p><p>Mu Qing was getting rather impatient.</p><p>“Well then? Don’t keep me waiting,” he said, managing to sound imperious despite the anticipatory heat that rushed through him at the thought of Feng Xin’s hands and qi all over him again.  </p><p>“Eager, are we?” Feng Xin was wearing that infuriating smirk again.</p><p>Mu Qing rolled his eyes. “Can you blame me? Anyone would want — ah!”</p><p><em>Anyone would want this curse gone as soon as possible</em>, was what he had meant to say, but Feng Xin had suddenly (finally) stroked his ankle with a burst of qi and Mu Qing immediately lost his train of thought.</p><p>Now that he was more practiced at using his qi this way, Feng Xin was moving a little faster, but Mu Qing didn’t mind. While it still felt good, it seemed his feet and lower legs were less sensitive than everywhere else Feng Xin had touched so far, and he was impatient for Feng Xin to hurry and move to his thighs.</p><p>Mu Qing had spent many a night running his fingers over his inner thighs to rile himself up, imagining it was Feng Xin’s hands touching him instead, and just as many nights imagining Feng Xin lined up against his back, pressing his thighs together and fucking between them.</p><p>Not that he’d be opposed to fucking Feng Xin’s thighs either.</p><p>Either way, thinking about it was quickly ramping up Mu Qing’s arousal, and this time, his cock was exposed, out in the open for Feng Xin to see exactly how much he was affecting Mu Qing.</p><p>When Feng Xin’s hand made it to the back of his knee, Mu Qing gasped and nearly kicked him by accident, and Feng Xin’s fingers tightened on his skin, his qi coming a little faster.</p><p>“Good?” he asked, voice low and rough.</p><p>Mu Qing’s qi surged to match the energy of Feng Xin’s without his input again, and he couldn’t speak from the intensity of it, so he just nodded, clutching the sheets.</p><p>He’d wondered if maybe it was a one-time thing, the way that earlier that night, their qi had wrapped together just as desperately as their bodies — but even after the novelty of it had worn off, it was still happening.</p><p>Maybe…maybe this really was dual cultivation, then, even though they hadn’t intended for it to be. Maybe it wasn’t just Mu Qing’s body and heart that were inexorably drawn to Feng Xin like this, but his spirit too — and maybe Feng Xin’s spirit was reaching right back.</p><p>Feng Xin certainly seemed affected by it too — his eyes had closed for a long moment, his brows furrowed and his breath coming faster, and when they opened he pinned Mu Qing with his gaze, eyes half-lidded and dark.</p><p>“Mu Qing,” he breathed.</p><p>Then he dropped Mu Qing’s leg and surged forward to kiss him, pressing him into the bed.</p><p>It was a long, desperate kiss, and Mu Qing lost track of time, wrapping his arms around Feng Xin’s neck and sinking a hand into his hair.</p><p>Finally, Feng Xin broke away, panting, and Mu Qing let out an involuntary noise of complaint, leaning up to chase his mouth.</p><p>“Fuck, I can’t —” Feng Xin groaned, and gave Mu Qing two more quick kisses before pulling away fully and sitting back on his knees. “We can’t do that if you want me to stay focused. I could kiss you for days and still not get enough.”</p><p>Mu Qing stared at him, eyes wide. Did Feng Xin truly like it that much? It certainly looked like he did, flushed as he was, his cock hard and leaking. </p><p>And if he really meant it, if he truly wanted to kiss Mu Qing for days…</p><p>Still dazed from the intensity of the kiss and their qi intertwining, a suggestion that would have terrified Mu Qing just earlier that night slipped out of him without a second thought.</p><p>“…After,” he said quietly.</p><p>Feng Xin had pulled Mu Qing’s other leg across his lap, about to start removing the curse again, but he froze upon hearing Mu Qing, hands hovering just above his skin. “Huh?” He tilted his head, expression confused — fuck, that was unfairly cute. “After what?”</p><p>With every earnest word and every passionate touch, Feng Xin had been chasing away the little voice in Mu Qing’s head that told him Feng Xin was only doing this out of obligation, that told him that he’d want to stop as soon as they’d accomplished their goal — and now, finally, it was quiet enough that Mu Qing could muster up the confidence to ask for what he wanted.</p><p>“After the curse is gone. Kiss me more then.”</p><p>Well.</p><p>A part of what he wanted, anyway.</p><p>“Fuck, Mu Qing.” Feng Xin’s grip on his leg tightened, sending another small surge of qi into him. “You can’t just say shit like that. Do you…do you really mean that?” He searched Mu Qing’s face, expression open and hopeful.</p><p>Mu Qing nodded seriously.</p><p>“<em>Fuck</em>,” Feng Xin repeated, emphatically.</p><p>Then his hands sped up, and in no time at all, Mu Qing’s legs were free of the curse up to the knee, and Feng Xin scooted closer, kneeling between Mu Qing’s legs with a hand on each one. He stroked his fingers up the back of his thighs, making Mu Qing shiver.</p><p>Hands smoothing up and down his thighs, Feng Xin stared at Mu Qing, eyes dark and nearly as hot as his touch as they lingered on Mu Qing’s lips, his chest, his cock.</p><p>“Fuck, you look so good like this. All disheveled because of me. And that robe. There’s no way you don’t know how fucking fantastic you look in dark red, are you trying to kill me?”</p><p>“If this is enough to kill you, I’ve — hah — apparently greatly overestimated your strength,” Mu Qing gasped out, breath unsteady as Feng Xin’s fingers blazed a trail of qi everywhere he touched.</p><p>“Or you’ve greatly underestimated yours,” Feng Xin countered, more smug than he should’ve been, considering what he was arguing for.</p><p>“T-that’s — ah!” Before Mu Qing had a chance to say anything, Feng Xin bent over and pressed a kiss to his hip, transferring spiritual energy with his mouth. Mu Qing’s hands flew to Feng Xin’s head, burying themselves in his hair.</p><p>Oh fuck — why hadn’t they done this before, they could have been kissing the curse away this whole time!</p><p>Mu Qing wanted to complain about it, but having Feng Xin’s lips on him had somehow broken the connection between his brain and his mouth, and he could do nothing but gasp mindlessly as Feng Xin stroked his thighs and licked a stripe up the crease below his hip — he was leaking so much that it left a puddle of precum on his stomach, and Feng Xin slowly kissed his way across Mu Qing’s abdomen before licking that up too.</p><p>“Salty,” he commented.</p><p>He didn’t say it with any particular tone of voice, but Mu Qing still stiffened, his eyes flying open to examine Feng Xin’s expression for any sign of disgust. “No one’s forcing you to taste it.”</p><p>“That’s not what I — it’s not a bad thing! It was just an observation,” Feng Xin insisted. “Besides, I really don’t fucking care how you taste. Even if it was like drinking the ocean I’d still find it hot.”</p><p>Mu Qing’s mouth screwed up in distaste. “What? Why?”</p><p>“Because it’s you,” Feng Xin said simply.</p><p>Mu Qing felt his face heating up to a concerning degree. “H-how does that make any sense? If it tastes bad, why does it matter who— mmph!”</p><p>Then Feng Xin was suddenly kissing him, open-mouthed and messy and pressing him into the bed, and Mu Qing groaned, realizing he could taste himself on Feng Xin’s tongue — it was indeed slightly salty, but Mu Qing found that he somehow didn’t care, too swept up in Feng Xin’s words and the insistent press of his mouth.</p><p>The kiss lasted much longer than was necessary to prove his point, but eventually Feng Xin did pull back.</p><p>“Hah, see?” he said, breathless and clearly pleased with himself. “Not so bad, is it?”</p><p>In any other situation, Feng Xin’s smug grin would have irritated Mu Qing to no end, but right now he couldn’t seem to muster up anything more than a fond eye roll.</p><p>“Whatever. It was…fine. But don’t expect me to be so magnanimous — if you taste like the ocean I will <em>not</em> be swallowing.”</p><p>For some reason, this made Feng Xin laugh so hard that he lost his balance from where he was hovering over Mu Qing, collapsing on top of him and muffling his snorts into Mu Qing’s chest.</p><p>Heart so full it could burst, Mu Qing wrapped an arm around him and tipped them both over so they were facing each other on their sides, not bothering to remove his arm from around Feng Xin’s waist.</p><p>“Your sense of humor never fails to baffle me,” he said dryly, once Feng Xin had calmed down.</p><p>“I don’t know, your expression was just so fucking indignant,” Feng Xin said, huffing another small laugh. “As if I would ever object to you not swallowing, instead of just being fucking delighted you want to put your mouth on me at all.” He put a hand on Mu Qing’s hip, eyes going darker when Mu Qing sucked in a breath. “Fuck. I never thought— this is really real, right? It’s not a dream?”</p><p>Mu Qing snorted softly. “…I’ve been asking myself the same thing.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s hand clutched at his waist. “Mu Qing,” he breathed. “You’ve dreamed about this?”</p><p>Flushing, Mu Qing looked down, avoiding Feng Xin’s eyes. The words <em>‘for 800 years’</em> threatened to spill out of his lips, but he managed to swallow them down roughly. “…Maybe I have, maybe I haven’t.”</p><p>“Of course you can’t just fucking say yes like a normal person.” A smile was slowly growing on Feng Xin’s face, and he leaned in to kiss Mu Qing again, a hand cupping his jaw and sending shivers down his spine.</p><p>“What does it matter if you understood me anyway,” Mu Qing grumbled, once Feng Xin let up enough for him to speak.</p><p>Feng Xin didn’t answer, instead starting up a flow of qi and letting a hand slide down to squeeze at Mu Qing’s ass. Mu Qing moaned and clutched at him, suddenly abruptly aware of how his erection had not flagged even slightly during their little interlude, and of how the only places left on his body that were still cursed were below his hips and above his thighs. “Feng Xin,” he gasped.</p><p>“Mu Qing,” Feng Xin answered.</p><p>Then, with no warning whatsoever, he stroked Mu Qing’s cock, and the rush of his qi and the sudden warmth of his hand as the curse was cleared nearly made Mu Qing come.</p><p>“Ahh — Feng Xin —” he cried, back arching at the sheer pleasure of it. He pulled Feng Xin flush against him, and gasped at the intensity of finally feeling their cocks sliding together, grinding into him until they were both panting and desperate. “Feng Xin, fuck, you feel, ahh — <em>so good</em>…”</p><p>Feng Xin moaned in response. “I want to — can I eat you out? I can multitask, I’ll keep transferring qi for the curse, just — please.”</p><p>Mu Qing did not need any coaxing whatsoever. “<em>Yes</em>, yes, do it,” he gasped.</p><p>After pressing a searing kiss to his lips, Feng Xin tipped Mu Qing onto his back and slid down the bed until he was between Mu Qing’s thighs again. Both his hands roamed the curves of Mu Qing’s ass, searing away the curse with his qi and yanking Mu Qing’s hips towards his face. With a groan, Feng Xin pressed an open-mouthed kiss to the base of Mu Qing’s cock and nuzzled into it.</p><p>“Fuck. How do you always smell so good, all sweaty like this?” Feng Xin’s hips jerked against the bed as he mouthed over Mu Qing’s balls. “Drives me fucking crazy when we spar. Always wanted to — nnh, always wanted to pin you down like this, make you lose it so you know exactly what you do to me.”</p><p>“Thought you were — ahh, thought you were going to eat me out?” Mu Qing said, breathless and trembling in anticipation. “All talk and no action, I see.”</p><p>Feng Xin nipped his inner thigh in retaliation. “I’ll show you no action,” he grumbled nonsensically, and Mu Qing let out a startled burst of laughter that quickly turned to a strangled moan as Feng Xin hauled Mu Qing’s legs over his shoulders and sealed his mouth against Mu Qing’s hole like he was starving for it.</p><p>“Feng Xin, Feng Xin, <em>ahh</em>—” Mu Qing gasped as his hands flew to Feng Xin’s hair and gripped on for dear life. “Nnnh, fuck, yes, how are you so, <em>good</em>,” he babbled mindlessly, too lost in the pleasure to think about what he was saying.</p><p>Moaning at the praise, Feng Xin sent an inadvertent surge of qi into him, and the combined heat and vibration made Mu Qing feel like he was losing his mind.</p><p>Feng Xin was kissing his hole as thoroughly and deeply as he’d kissed his mouth, lips firm and then soft again, tongue slick and wet against his rim before pressing inside, fucking into him just enough to make Mu Qing writhe and grind down onto his tongue before pulling back to kiss and suck at his opening again.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Feng Xin, yes, <em>like that.</em>” </p><p>Every noise of pleasure Mu Qing let out was met with an answering noise from Feng Xin, and he sounded incredible, every groan cracked and desperate, winding the arousal in Mu Qing’s stomach ever tighter and making him leak all over his stomach.</p><p>It all felt so insanely good that Mu Qing was losing his mind, every touch of Feng Xin’s lips and tongue driving him wild. The constant electric flow of Feng Xin’s qi had made him even more sensitive — so much so that when Feng Xin finally pulled away to suck in a shaky breath, the sudden puff of air across Mu Qing’s wet hole alone was enough to make him shudder and come. </p><p>“Ahhhh, Feng Xin, I’m —” he gasped, his hips twitching up into nothing as he spilled onto his stomach.</p><p>Feng Xin’s grip on his thighs tightened.</p><p>“Oh fuck, Mu Qing, that was so fucking hot, you come for me so easily, I — I’m so close, fuck,” Feng Xin panted, staring at him hungrily and grinding messily into the bed.</p><p>“Come here,” Mu Qing gasped, and yanked Feng Xin upwards, desperate to get his mouth on Feng Xin.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes widened in surprise, but he went easily, letting Mu Qing manhandle him so that he was kneeling over Mu Qing’s face, legs trembling and cock leaking profusely.</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>,” Mu Qing hissed. Then he yanked Feng Xin’s hips down to mouth messily at the side of his cock.</p><p>He had no idea at all what he was doing, so he just went with what felt right and what made Feng Xin moan the most, kissing and sucking wetly along the length, down over his balls and back up again, nuzzling into the hair at the base, breathless with his own enthusiasm.</p><p>Fuck, if Mu Qing hadn’t already come twice tonight he would have gotten hard again already at the strangled noises Feng Xin was making, at the warmth and the musky smell of him and the way he was gasping Mu Qing’s name.</p><p>“Mu Qing, I — fuck, Mu Qing, your mouth feels incredible, ahh, fuck, please, I’m — Mu Qing, <em>Mu Qing</em> —”</p><p>Mu Qing only barely had time to seal his lips over the head of Feng Xin’s cock before Feng Xin was coming, legs shaking and hips rocking in tiny little thrusts, filling Mu Qing’s mouth with his cum.</p><p>The taste…was not as bad as Mu Qing had been expecting, honestly. It was certainly salty, but not enough to make him gag, and he was so wrapped up in the high of having made Feng Xin come that he swallowed without even thinking about it, moaning lightly and gripping tightly onto Feng Xin’s hips.</p><p>After a long moment, Feng Xin suddenly went boneless above him, and Mu Qing grunted at having to suddenly hold up his weight to avoid being crushed. “Come on, off,” he said, patting Feng Xin’s hip, and Feng Xin groaned and tipped backwards, sprawling onto the bed like none of his muscles were working at all.</p><p>Mu Qing snorted, unable to stop a fond smile from spreading across his face, and quickly cleaned off his stomach with a corner of the sheets — they’d need to be washed anyway — before plastering himself to Feng Xin’s side, resting his head against Feng Xin's chest (which was even more comfortable than Mu Qing had imagined) and throwing an arm across his waist. </p><p>They laid there for a while, Mu Qing’s head blissfully empty of thoughts for once. </p><p>Eventually Feng Xin groaned and sat up, stretching his back with a concerningly loud pop. Then he sat back against the headboard and pulled Mu Qing onto his lap, kissing aimlessly at his neck and running a hand through Mu Qing’s messy hair.</p><p>“You good?” Feng Xin mumbled.</p><p>He seemed a little out of it still, and Mu Qing huffed a laugh. “I am. Are you?”</p><p>“Mmmmm,” he groaned against Mu Qing’s neck, holding him a little tighter.</p><p>When no other answer was forthcoming, Mu Qing pulled back a little. “…Is that a yes?” he asked, trying not to tense up.</p><p>Feng Xin nodded into his neck, and after a long moment, he lifted his head, the haziness finally clearing from his eyes. “I didn’t know it could be that good,” he admitted, voice hoarse.</p><p>Mu Qing frowned. “What do you mean? Aren’t you the one who actually has experience with this?”</p><p>“I mean…it was only one time. And it was nothing like this.”</p><p>“What…? Are you telling me you managed to get a girl pregnant the first and only time you fucked her?”</p><p>Feng Xin shrugged, looking abashed. “I…guess so.”</p><p>Mu Qing couldn’t stop himself from cackling. “Hahahaha, holy shit, you really are a fertility god, <em>Ju Yang</em>, hahahahaha!”</p><p>Instead of getting upset at the Ju Yang moniker like he used to, Feng Xin just stared up at Mu Qing, a slowly growing smile on his face. “Pfft, shut the fuck up,” he said lightly.</p><p>“Wait, hold on. If it was nothing like this time, and you enjoyed this —” Mu Qing paused, suddenly unsure. “You did…enjoy this, right?”</p><p>Feng Xin rolled his eyes in response, but he was still smiling. “I literally just said it was good! And I was telling you it was good the whole damn time!” He leaned in and kissed Mu Qing, long and deep, then pulled back, a blush rising on his cheeks. “Yes, I enjoyed it. So fucking much, Mu Qing. You have no idea.”</p><p>“Then, does that mean, with Jian Lan, it was — bad?”</p><p>“I mean, not <em>bad</em>. It was fine. I guess I liked that she seemed to enjoy it. But it felt just like getting myself off, only more awkward and stressful. I thought, ‘maybe sex really isn’t all it’s cracked up to be, or maybe it’s just not for me?’” He looked at Mu Qing and huffed a small laugh. “It turns out I just wasn’t having sex with the right person. And I was a fucking idiot, because he was right in front of me all along.”</p><p>Mu Qing froze.</p><p>“…You…you mean me,” he said after a long moment, voice shaky with disbelief.</p><p>“Of course I mean you, dumbass. Who else has been by my side this entire time?”</p><p>“W-well, your senior deputies, for one —”</p><p>“Fucking hell, Mu Qing, you know that’s not the point,” Feng Xin groaned, flinging his hands up in exasperation. The loss of their warmth on Mu Qing’s waist instantly made him feel bereft, and then irritated at himself for letting a small touch affect him so much.</p><p>Mu Qing had half a mind to drop his own hands from Feng Xin’s shoulders in retaliation, but they had a will of their own and refused to let go of Feng Xin.</p><p>“What is the point then?” he huffed. “At this rate I’ll fall asleep before you manage to —”</p><p>“Mu Qing.” Feng Xin interrupted. He put his hands back on Mu Qing's hips, holding him tightly. “The point is I fucking like you. I want to do this with you for another 800 years. And — not just sex,” he clarified, before Mu Qing could say anything. “I — I want to spend more time with you, and hold you, and come home to you. Fuck. I want…I want you to be mine.”</p><p>Feng Xin’s face was flushed, but his expression was earnest and determined, and it was making Mu Qing’s heart feel like it might beat right out of his chest.</p><p>Mu Qing swallowed, throat dry. “I...already am yours,” he croaked after a long moment.</p><p>Feng Xin’s expression cracked, surprise and relief and joy bursting over his face before he flung his arms around Mu Qing’s waist, pulled him impossibly closer on his lap, and wrapped him in a crushing hug.</p><p>“Mu Qing. Fuck. Fuck, I love you,” he whispered fiercely into Mu Qing’s neck.</p><p>Mu Qing felt weak, suddenly grateful they were still on the bed — he felt so shaky his legs might have given out if they’d been standing. Holding Feng Xin just as tightly, Mu Qing pressed a kiss into his hair, nuzzling into it. The smell of his own hair oil on Feng Xin made everything feel even more overwhelming.</p><p>“I... the same,” Mu Qing managed after a long moment, wincing at his inability to say he loved Feng Xin properly. He’d have thought 800 years of experiencing it would make it easier to say, but...apparently not.</p><p>Feng Xin didn’t seem to mind, though, because when his face emerged from where he’d buried it in Mu Qing’s shoulder, he was beaming. </p><p>“Yeah?” Feng Xin’s smile turned half-teasing, half-serious. “Does that mean you’ll let me touch you in public? Put my arm around your waist? Maybe even…hold your hand?” He slid one of Mu Qing’s arms off from around his shoulders and pressed their palms together, intertwining their fingers.</p><p>“Feng Xin. I’ve already been letting you do the first two for months,” Mu Qing pointed out, feeling a flush rise to his cheeks.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes went wide. “Fuck, you’re right…you have, haven’t you?” He hummed, pleased, and his other hand came up from Mu Qing’s back to stroke gently at the base of his neck, making Mu Qing shiver. “Is that a yes to the hand-holding, too, then?”</p><p>“…Do whatever you want,” Mu Qing mumbled, his face practically on fire.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyebrows flew up. “<em>Whatever</em> I want?” His gaze dropped to Mu Qing’s lips. “…Even this?” </p><p>Then he leaned in for a slow, deep kiss that left them both breathless before pulling back to wait for Mu Qing’s answer.</p><p>Unfortunately, he had kissed the words right out of Mu Qing’s mouth.</p><p>“Mm,” Mu Qing said, stalling for time, and pulled Feng Xin back to his mouth with a small groan.</p><p>To his own surprise, Mu Qing couldn’t think of any public displays of affection, short of actual public sex, that he would truly object to. The idea of Feng Xin wanting everyone to know just what they were to each other was thrilling enough that it far outweighed the instinctual embarrassment he would probably feel at first.</p><p>“Whatever you want,” he reiterated, mumbling the words into Feng Xin’s mouth. “I’ll — I’ll tell you if anything is too much, but…it probably won’t be.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Feng Xin said, amazed. He leaned his forehead against Mu Qing’s. “Wow. You really fucking like me, huh?”</p><p>The crinkles around his eyes when he smiled that widely were really too fucking cute.</p><p>“Oh, shut up,” said Mu Qing, smiling back.</p><p>Feng Xin’s eyes dropped to that smile, and he leaned in and kissed it like he couldn’t help himself. “I can’t believe it took a fucking curse for us to get here,” he mumbled against Mu Qing’s lips. Then he suddenly stiffened, hands tightening against Mu Qing’s skin. “Oh fuck, the curse!” He pulled back a little and looked Mu Qing up and down. “I think I removed it all, I was trying to be thorough, but —”</p><p>“If you’re not sure, then you’ll just have to check again, won’t you?” Mu Qing interrupted, still smiling. “So stop talking and hurry up and touch me.”</p><p>Then he tipped them both sideways, kissed Feng Xin so thoroughly into the bed he couldn’t say a word even if he wanted to, and they spent the rest of the night ensuring — with complete certainty — that there wasn’t a single inch of Mu Qing’s skin Feng Xin had not touched.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>A week later, at the monthly meeting of the Upper Court, the two gods of the south entered the meeting hall late, rumpled, and even more joined at the hip than usual.</p><p>Ling Wen was too professional to call them out on it, simply continuing with the meeting after a small sigh, but she could feel Pei Ming’s eyes burning into her every now and then, practically begging her to look at him so he could gloat with his expression.</p><p>She did not give in: the meeting was already scrambled enough without her becoming distracted as well, what with everyone taking sneaky glances at the southern gods, mumbling among themselves and surreptitiously exchanging merits — there had apparently been an enormous number of bets placed on when the two would finally get together.</p><p>To her surprise, though, neither of the generals appeared to be the slightest bit bothered by the attention, acting as if there was nothing at all out of the ordinary. The only indication that they’d even noticed was a light blush on Xuan Zhen’s usually impassive face.</p><p>It was so difficult to get anything accomplished that Ling Wen finally called the meeting to an end early, letting out a long sigh when the room immediately burst into loud chatter and massaging her brows with a single hand.</p><p>On the bright side, everyone was too distracted to ask anything of her after the meeting as they usually did, so Ling Wen was able to slip out of the room with none the wiser.</p><p>Once she’d made it out of the building, she hesitated a moment, and then reluctantly lingered on the steps, waiting for the inevitable shout —</p><p>“Noble Jie!”</p><p>— And there he was.</p><p>Before Pei Ming came into view, Ling Wen started walking down the steps again as if she’d never paused to begin with.</p><p>“Pei Ming,” she acknowledged.</p><p>Once he caught up to her, he jogged a few paces ahead and began walking backwards so they could face each other, somehow still elegant even when descending the steps. Showoff.</p><p>“What, no congratulations?” Pei Ming complained, pretending to sound hurt. “I know you saw our dear southern generals all cozied up in there.”</p><p>“What congratulations? Certainly not for you,” Ling Wen scoffed. “And as for the happy couple, they have plenty of people congratulating them already. I’ll catch them at a quieter time.”</p><p>Pei Ming laughed. “Congratulations for our plan working, of course! I just knew that ghost would do the trick.”</p><p>Of course, he’d said that about every previously failed plan as well, but that fact didn’t seem to dampen his spirits in the slightest.</p><p>“And,” he added cheerfully, “it wouldn’t have worked without your help. So congratulations to you too!”</p><p>This was giving Ling Wen entirely too much credit — the only thing she’d really done that wasn’t part of her job was not telling the generals about her suspicion that Pei Ming knew more about the ghost than he’d let on — but she’d take it, regardless.</p><p>“Instead of congratulations, how about compensation, then, if you’re so pleased about it?”</p><p>“Done!” Pei Ming acquiesced surprisingly easily. “What do you want? Anything for my dearest friend.” He grinned. “Within reason, of course.”</p><p>Ling Wen hummed. This was an excellent chance to ask him for something extravagant, or perhaps embarrassing, but his joy was unfortunately contagious, and besides — all she truly wanted was some time off.</p><p>“Am I correct in saying that, as a love god, you’ve gotten a tidy increase in merits from successfully setting up two such powerful gods?”</p><p>Pei Ming chuckled. “It’s less than you might think, really, seeing as they’d already been in love for ages without my intervention. But if this is your way of asking me to spot you the merits to hire a few new deputies…”</p><p>Ling Wen smiled. “You know me too well.”</p><p>“Then it’s done.” Pei Ming spun around and bumped their shoulders together as they walked back to her palace, and Ling Wen let his chatter about the latest gossip wash over her.</p><p>The capital streets seemed more peaceful than they had been in ages, and she’d just started to truly relax when one of her deputies timidly called for her in the array.</p><p>“Ling Wen Zhenjun…”</p><p>“Yes, what is it?”</p><p>“You won’t like to hear this, but, um, Nan Yang and Xuan Zhen have broken a pillar in the main square again. Only — ah, this time, they weren’t exactly fighting…”</p><p>Ling Wen sighed deeply.</p><p>Ah, it was naive to think that even love could make those two change their ways.</p><p>Martial gods…really.</p>
