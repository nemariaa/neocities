This site uses modified versions of [kingdra.net](https://kingdra.net/fan/)'s [fic masterlist template](https://kingdra.net/masterlist-template/) and [css styling for fics downloaded from AO3](https://kingdra.net/fan/ao3css/).
The main changes I've made are:
1. adding a dark mode button on both the masterlist and each individual fic
2. modifying the padding in style.css, and padding and borders in ao3-style.css so that the text/borders aren't right up against the edge of the screen at some window widths

Please feel free to use/modify however you'd like.
